Splotch is written in the C++ language. To install it you have just to 
1) unpack the tar.gz 
2) Edit the Makefile
3) "make"

Please Check your compiler for the OpenMP flags if you want to use 
OpenMP functionality (-fopenmp for g++).

If you have an MPI environment installed, you can also turn
on the USE_MPI option.

For producing image sequences, use the other options in the 
Makefile (e.g. INTERPOLATE, etc. ...)

To run it on your simulations, have a look into the splotch.par
file and set the parameters you prefer.

As Splotch reads simulation data in binary format, you have to
write your simulations using Gadget 
(http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~volker/gadget/index.html) 
and choosing SnapFormat = 2. 
Endian conversion will be done automaticly.
