\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The management and analysis of modern, large-scale datasets generated by scientific experiments, e.g. through physical observations \cite{} or numerical simulations \cite{}, can be very challenging due to continuously increasing sizes and complexity. Traditional data mining and analysis methods often rely on computationally complex
algorithms \cite{} which can be very expensive if employed for 
large-scale datasets \cite{}. Visual exploration and discovery can then represent invaluable tools, e.g. by providing scientists with prompt and intuitive insights enabling them to identify interesting characteristics and thus define regions of interest within which
to apply time-consuming methods. Additionally, they can be a very effective way in discovering and understanding correlations in data patterns, or in identifying unexpected behaviours, thus saving valuable resources, e.g. by terminating promptly on going numerical simulations producing unreliable results. Visual exploration and discovery tools can also provide effective means for communicating scientific results not only to researchers \cite{} but also to members of the general public \cite{}.

There is a long tradition within astrophysical communities in developing and deploying visual discovery tools for large-scale datasets represented by images, complex surveys, data cubes or N-body simulations. Consequently astrophysics represents an ideal discipline for exploiting High Performance Computing (HPC) devices, e.g. large multi-core and multi-node systems, providing all necessary resources for coping with large-scale datasets, e.g. computational power, large memory sizes, sufficient storage capacities and fast network speeds. A recent example is given by Hassan et al. (see related works and references in \cite{2012ASPC..461...45H}), who focus on forthcoming generations of radio surveys (ASKAP and SKA \cite{}), which are expected to produce very large datasets. Visual tools play a crucial role in exploring data cubes through a mesh-based volume rendering approach boosted by the efficient usage of GPUs. A further example, is given by Fraedrich et al. \cite{Fraedrich:2009:TMV}, who
investigated scalability in visualizing large-scale particle-based cosmological 
simulations focusing on the Millennium run \cite{millennium}, and presented methods to reduce the associated limitations on PC architectures based on levels-of-detail.
Recently Kaheler et al. \cite{2012arXiv1208.3206K} presented an algorithm specifically designed for N-body simulations. Their approach is based on a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain with mesh vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions and offers several GPU-assisted rendering solutions. This article includes an excellent review of methods for effective visualisation of particle based datasets (the reader is referred to \cite{2012arXiv1208.3206K} for details).

A number of popular, open-source software packages attempt to address the challenges associated with large-scale datasets and exploitation of HPC devices, e.g. VisIt \cite{visit} and Paraview \cite{paraview}. Both are based on VTK \cite{vtk} and support a fairly large variety of data types, file formats and visual discovery solutions. They can be used either as stand alone tools (running on a user's workstation) or in a client-server configuration (deploying services remotely). Both tools support in-situ visualization allowing visualization procedures to be embedded in a simulation, thus generating images during a simulation run (i.e. no data files are required) and enabling computational steering. An application of ParaView to large-scale cosmological simulations can be found in \cite{2011ApJS..195...11W}. Neither of the these packages provides customised tools for astrophysics,  e.g. particle visualization capabilities are limited. Often the underlying computational performances and/or memory usage are not highly optimized, thus preventing effective deployment of these packages on modern, large-scale astrophysical datasets. A VTK-based open-source software package focusing on astrophysics is VisIVO \cite{}. Although its main limitation is lack of interactivity, it has been recently released in the form of a science gateway offering a web-based, workflow-enabled framework seamlessly integrating large-scale, multi-dimensional datasets and applications for processing and visualization by exploiting distributed computing infrastructures \cite{}. Advanced users are able to create, change, invoke, and monitor workflows while standard users are provided with customized web interfaces hiding all underlying technical aspects. Tipsy \cite{tipsyurl} and Splash \cite{splash} are further examples of software packages specifically designed for particle-based datasets. Applicability of these packages to large-scale datasets is limited as they operate in stand-alone mode without any support for HPC resources.

This paper concentrates on {\it Splotch} \cite{2008NJPh...10l5006D} which is a ray-casting algorithm for effectively visualizing large-scale, particle-based numerical simulations. Very high-quality visualisations can be generated by Splotch for modern large-scale cosmological simulations, e.g. the Millennium trilogy \cite{millennium}, the Horizon and MareNostrum runs \cite{horizon} or the DEUS simulation \cite{deus}. The underlying models in these simulations typically reproduce the evolution of a representative fraction of the universe by means of hundreds of billions of fluid elements (described as particles) and interacting with each other through gravitational forces. The typical size of a fixed time output (or {\it snapshot}) employed by Splotch can range from several hundreds of GBs to a number of tens of TBs recording ID, position and velocity of particles together with additional properties, e.g. local smoothing length, density and velocity dispersion. Although developed for numerical simulations, Splotch has being successfully used 
also in other contexts, e.g. visualizing real galaxy systems \cite{}.

%, whose 3D shape is carefully modeled
%according to observational data. Here, more than the data size, the driver is
%the quality and the level of details of the final images,
%that have to reproduce the full details and the
%spectacular features of astronomical objects. Furthermore,
%it was adopted also for the visualization of meshed based astrophysical simulations
%(although the same high quality cannot be achieved unless extremely high resolution
%meshes are provided).

The original Splotch algorithm has been optimized in terms of memory usage and exploitation of standard HPC architectures, e.g. multi-core processors and multi-node supercomputing systems by adopting the MPI paradigm \cite{jin:high-performance} and OpenMP (see Appendix). However nowadays HPC systems are increasingly populated with GPUs employed not just as graphic accelerators but also as computational co-processors providing outstanding performances with power consumption being comparable to standard CPUs \cite{}. On suitable classes of algorithms, GPUs can ensure speed-up factors of about an order of magnitude with respect to that of standard multicore CPU \cite{}. Supercomputers are thus increasingly equipped with several hundreds of GPUs that can overlap their computing capability with that of CPUs, minimising considerably overall times-to-solution of high-end scientific problems.

This paper discusses the issues we faced in designing and implementing a new version of Splotch using the CUDA paradigm to fully exploit modern HPC infrastructures. The main issue was optimizing rendering of variable radius particles, dependent both on their intrinsic size and on the point of view, posing several problems for the GPU computation in terms of race conditions and workload balancing. A preliminary investigation as reported in \cite{jin:high-performance} had to be redesigned from the ground up to avoid data transfers during GPU computation. We have deployed the Thrust library \cite{thrusturl} and designed a number of optimized solutions for rendering particles according to a new classification strategy. Our approach can accelerate the original Splotch up to a factor of 6, when compared to a single core, and 
can give performance comparable to that of cores using the shared memory parallel model. 
This improved performance is achieved without affecting the performance features of the original Splotch - linear scalability on the number of particles and image sizes. Section~2 is a short description of the Splotch algorithmic approach. Background on GPU architectures and a performance model that guided our re-designing of Splotch are discussed in Section~3. Our implementation is presented in Section~4 in which we describe our strategy on how to classify particles and rendering them accordingly. Section~5 presents our reference datasets for benchmarking and discusses performance results including scalability related to sizes of datasets and smoothing radius. Section~6 presents conclusions and pointers to future developments.

\section{Splotch Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

Splotch generates very high-quality images through a customised ray-casting approach. Large-scale datasets are supported by exploiting HPC architectures by means of an effective mix of OpenMP / MPI parallel programming paradigms.  
%through an optimal usage of memory, i.e. no data replicas or unnecessary allocations, 64 bits support and usage of shared and distributed memories. The current implementation of Splotch \cite{} adheres to a simple software engineering design allowing for easy extensions, e.g. incorporating new data readers. 
The implementation of Splotch is self-contained with no dependencies from external libraries (apart of course from those needed for parallelism and to support specific file formats, e.g. HDF5 \cite{hdf5}). The code is pure C++ and compilation is straightforward through suitable makefile scripts. The operational scenario is described in detail in \cite{2008NJPh...10l5006D}. To aid the presentation in this paper the main stages of Splotch as summarised as below:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\it Data Loading} - Several readers are available supporting different formats. As a minimum ($x$, $y$, $z$) scalars are required representing the positions of particles in cartesian or any other (user-defined) customized coordinate systems.
\item
{\it Rasterization and Processing} - Firstly, normalisation together with other necessary 
calculations (e.g. logarithms of processed quantities) are performed. Secondly, particle 
coordinates and other geometric quantities (e.g. smoothing lengths - see below) are 
roto-translated and projected according to camera settings. 
At this point all active 
particles (i.e. contributing to the final rendering) are identified.
For the sake of simplicity in the following sections 
this phase will be referred to as {\it Rasterization}.
\item
{\it Rendering} - The contributions of individual particles to pixels of the final 
image are calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation  \cite{1991par..book.....S}:
\begin{equation}\label{rad}
\frac{d\bf{I^{\lambda}}{(\bf x)}}{dx}=(E-A\bf{I^{\lambda}}({\bf x}))\rho^{\lambda}({\bf x}),
\end{equation}
where $I^{\lambda}$ represents the three color components, red, green and blue ($\lambda$ = R, G and B), of the radiation intensity at position ${\bf x}$, $x$ is is the co-ordinate along the optical path, and $E$ and $A$ are the coefficients of radiation emission and absorption respectively. The quantity $\rho^{\lambda}({\bf x})$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation}\label{smooth}
\rho^{\lambda}({\bf x}) = \sum_{p=1}^{N_{part}} \rho_p W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_p$ is a discrete field transported by particles (e.g. mass density or temperature), and $W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi)$ is a smoothing kernel defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{kernel}
W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi) = \exp(-r_p^2/\sigma_p^2)\qquad {\rm for}\quad  r<\chi\sigma_p,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{kernel1}
W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi) = 0 \qquad {\rm for}\quad r>\chi\sigma_p,
\end{equation}
where
$r=\vert {\bf x_p}-{\bf x} \vert$ is the distance of the particle $p$ with coordinates ${\bf x_p}$ from ${\bf x}$ and $\sigma_p$ is a smoothing length defining a compact support for the
Gaussian distribution. The distribution is considered to be zero at a given
distance $\chi\cdot\sigma_p$, where $\chi$ is a suitably-defined multiplicative factor, so that any rays passing at distances larger than $\chi\sigma_p$ are completely unaffected by $\rho_p$.
\end{itemize}

Equation \eqref{rad} is solved for each color component using a finite differences 
approximation along a line of sight originating from each pixel on the final rendering. 
For most of astrophysical applications, where matter density is usually extremely low, the equation can be solved in the {\it optically thin} regime, where the absorbtion term can be neglected. This makes the calculation independent of integration order of particles, allowing a simplified parallel implementations of the algorithm, without affecting the rendering quality and the correcteness of the images. 
The RGB components can be defined by exploiting different physical quantities. For instance, colors 
can be associated to the three components of the velocity field $\bf v$, so that 
$\rho_p^{R}=v_x$, $\rho_p^{G}=v_y$ and $\rho_p^{B}=v_z$. Conversely, a scalar quantity, such as mass density or temperatures, can be mapped to the RGB components via colour look-up tables (or palettes).

\section{GPU Considerations}
\label{sec:gpu-code}
Although GPUs offer an excellent platform for improving performances of numerical codes, a complete redesign of algorithms is often necessary and dramatic improvements cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, even when moderate performance gains are achieved, GPU enabled codes allow full exploitation of modern HPC systems combining multicore processors with multiple GPUs. Splotch has been refactored by exploiting CUDA as discussed in Section~4. We review below the fundamentals of CUDA programming so as to discuss details of a performance model developed to guide our developments.

%The potential dependency of any pixel of the image from any data point,
%makes the distribution of work between GPU's cores challenging to implement
%and even harder to tune in terms both of performance and of memory requirements.
%In section XXX, we propose a simple performance model that has
%driven the implementation of the GPU enabled Splotch kernels.

\subsection{CUDA Paradigm} 
\label{sec:cuda}

The CUDA programming model \cite{cudaurl} by NVIDIA currently represents the standard ``de facto'' for GPU programming. The underlying GPUs are closely mapped leading to optimal performances. The obvious drawback of limited portability is somewhat mitigated by the diffusion of NVIDIA GPUs. Access to highly parallelized modern GPU architectures is offered through a simplified C/C++ or Fortran API supporting joint CPU/GPU execution. Serial procedures are performed by the CPU (host), while those which exhibit rich amount of data parallelism are performed by the GPU (device) realized as CUDA kernels. The CPU and GPU have their own memory spaces so data transfers from each other must use the PCI Express bus (hereafter PCI-E). 

The launch of CUDA kernels is asynchronous allowing the host to execute code instructions while the device is computing. If either of them requires a kernel execution to be completed then it is necessary to call a synchronization function. A kernel is instantiated as a grid of lightweight parallel threads organized into blocks of the same size. A thread represents an independent work element and maps to a hardware core (or streaming processor - SM). A {\em block} is a 1D, 2D or 3D set of concurrently executing threads that can cooperate among themselves via barrier synchronization and fast shared memory. This is possible because threads belonging to the same block are executed on the same SM. However synchronization is not possible between blocks. The limited amount of memory limits the number of  blocks that can reside in a particular SM simultaneously. Moreover when the execution of a block stalls, the runtime system switches to a different block - in other words there is no guaranteed order for the execution of blocks.

Once a block is assigned to a SM, it is partitioned into 32-thread units called {\em warps}. All threads belonging to a particular warp are scheduled to execute the same instruction (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread). To optimise performance programmers must thus ensure a minimal number of execution branches inside warps. Assigning a large number of warps to each SM (high occupancy) is also beneficial as the long waiting time of some warp instructions can be hidden by executing instructions from other warps and therefore selection of ready warps for execution does not introduce any idle times into the overall execution timeline - achieving zero-overhead thread scheduling. 

\subsection{Performance Model}
\label{sec:model}

The main computation in Splotch occurs during the stages of {\it Rasterization} and {\it Rendering}.
%The main parameters of the model are $N_{part}$, the number of particles
%to be processed, and $N_{pix}$, the number of pixels of the final image
%(in general we can consider square images with $N_{pix}=N_{pix}^2$). For 
%the Splotch's rendering kernel a third parameter must be introduced, 
%that is the average smoothing length of the particles,
%$R_s$. Its value depends both on the intrinsic "size" of the particle
%and on the position of the point of view (particle size increases getting closer to 
%the point of view).
%
%The kernels scale with these parameters as:
%\begin{align}\label{scaling}
%& N_{Norm} \propto N_{part},\\
%& N_{Geom} \propto N_{part},\\
%& N_{Color} \propto N_{part},\\
%%& N_{Sort} \propto N_{part}{\rm log}(N_{part}),\\
%& N_{Render} \propto N_{part} R_s^2,\\
%& N_{Image} \propto N_{pix}^2,
%\end{align}
%where $N_{kernel}$ is the number of operations for a given kernel.
%The Normalization, Geometry and Coloring kernels are  
%perfectly data parallel, each particle being processed independently from the others.
%Thus they are expected to fit the GPU programming model. 
%The Rendering kernel is, in general, the most computationally demanding. 
%The computational time depends in a predictable way with the number of particles and the number 
%of pixels. The most challenging dependecy, however, is from the smoothing length. 
%This dependency leads to strong changes in the computational effort and makes
%the work-load hard to balance, when this is distributed among many-processors
%systems.
The overall performance can be quantified as times spent on the CPU, the GPU
and for performing data transfers among different memories:
\begin{equation}\label{Ts}
T_{TOT} = T_{cpu} + T_{pci} + T_{gpu} + T_{Mgpu},
\end{equation}
where $T_{TOT}$ denotes total times, 
$T_{cpu}$ and $T_{gpu}$ represent times spent on the CPU and GPU respectively, $T_{pci}$ are times needed for data transfers from the CPU to GPU and vice-versa via PCI-E, and finally $T_{Mgpu}$ are times required for data transfers between the global and shared memory on the GPU. Although a class of particles (see our classification strategy described in section 4.1) is handled by the CPU, their processing times ($T_{cpu}$) are in general negligible compared to $T_{gpu}$, so these are embedded into GPU processing times by using the asyncronous operational mode of CUDA. The main terms of $\eqref{Ts}$ are discussed in more detail in the remainder of this section.

%{\bf CPU Computation}

\subsubsection{Data Transfers ($T_{pci}$)}
Let us denote by $S_{part}$ the number of \textit{Bytes} required for representing single particles (35 \textit{Bytes} are used in the current implementation). Assuming an overall number of particles $N_{part}$, the overall amount of \textit{Bytes} required to be transferred to the GPU is $N_{part} S_{part}$. Additionally the rendered images of Splotch calculated in the GPU are also required to be transferred to the CPU. Assuming square images (generalisation to rectangular images is pretty straightforward) and denoting $N_{pix}$ horizontal (or vertical) image resolutions, a number of $12 N_{pix}^2$ \textit{Bytes} (R, G, B float values) has to be transferred. To load particles into the GPU effectively datasets are split into chunks and are transferred to the GPU by using a loop - one after the other. As chuncks are being transferred, computation on chuncks already residing in the GPU memory is performed. The overall data transfer times are:
\begin{equation}\label{pci}
T_{pci} =  N_{chunks} \tau_{pci} + {N_{part} S_{part} + 12 N_{pix}^2 \over 
\mu_{pci}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{pci}$, $\mu_{pci}$ represent transfer time latency and bus bandwidth, and $N_{chunks}$ is the number of copy stages. Equation $\eqref{pci}$ indicates that performances depend linearly not only on the number of particles but also on the number of image resolution. Assuming very large-scale datasets ($N_{part} >> N_{pix}^2$) the contribution of $N_{pix}^2$ to $T_{pci}$ becomes negligible (as an example see test case described in section~\ref{sec:results} in which $N_{part} \sim 10^8$
and $N_{pix}^2 \sim 10^6$).

% and depending upon the relevant sizes (i.e. relative to the on board GPU memory) , we can deploy either a single or in a few operations, 
%depending on the data size (if it fits the available GPU memory) and/or
%in order to exploit CUDA streams, which allow to overlap communication 
%and computation, hiding the data transfer overhead. 
Splitting datasets into chunks does not cause any meaningful overheads if the copy latency is small, that is:
\begin{equation}
N_{chunks} < {N_{part} S_{part}\over \tau_{pci}\mu_{pci}}.
\end{equation}
As an example if $N_{part}$ is $O(10^8)$, then $N_{chunks}$ can be up to $10^5$ before
generating any overheads. Data transfers in addition to the ones described by equation $\eqref{pci}$ may be required by Splotch (for details on this aspect see Section~\ref{sec:implementation}).

%\medskip
%\noindent
%{\bf GPU Computation}
\subsubsection{GPU Computation ($T_{gpu}$)}
%\noindent
The time required for processing particles on the GPU can be estimated by:
\begin{equation}
T_{gpu} = N_{op}/\nu_{GPU}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{GPU}$ is the GPU's flops/sec rate, and $N_{op}$ is the overall number of operations:
\begin{equation}\label{ops}
N_{op} = N_{part}(\alpha + \beta R_s^2) + f_{GPU},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ representing the number of operations in the \textit{Rasterization} and \textit{Rendering} kernels respectively. The function 
$f_{GPU}$ takes into account other GPU specific kernels (i.e. procedures
which are not present in the original Splotch) that are necessary for the GPU implementation
(see section Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.
Finally the parameter $R_s$ encapsulates an expectation value for the radius of particles $R_s = <r(p)>$,

\begin{equation}\label{radius}
r(p) = A(p){\chi \sigma_p\over S_{box}} N_{pix},
\end{equation} 
where $A(p)$ is the transformation to rendered image coordinates, $\chi$ and $\sigma_p$ are defined by equation \eqref{smooth} and $S_{box}$ represents a computational box for input datasets. 
The radius of individual particles depends both on their intrinsic properties and on camera settings. Although a particle may exhibit a negligible size from one point of view, it may affect the entire rendered image from another. Also, particles close to each other can have different radius depending on their intrinsic characteristics.

The dependency from $r(p)$ is the source of two major problems for GPU implementations. Firstly, two threads acting on different particles could try 
to update the same image coordinates (see Figure~\ref{fig:particles}) causing concurrent accesses to memory thus leading to erroneous results. 
Secondly, different particles can affect different numbers of pixels. Therefore, it is hard to achieve optimal load balancing among threads.  
Customized solutions must thus be adopted to circumvent the aforementioned problems while avoiding paying large performance penalties. For instance, atomic updates (supported by CUDA) could be adopted for a safe update of the pixel value. However, this would have led to the serialization of the algorithm and thus, to a drop of the performance. 

To conclude this section we observe that $T_{gpu}$ depends linearly on the number of particles ($N_{part}$). This feature is important to be preserved in a GPU implementation of Splotch - $f_{GPU}$ should not introduce any higher order dependency.

\label{fig:particles}
\end{figure}


%\medskip
%\noindent
%{\bf Memory Access}
\subsubsection{Accessing Memory ($T_{Mgpu}$)}
%\noindent
Data transfers between global and shared memory can be estimated 
as the sum of the number of loads 
GPU's global to shared memory plus number of stores from shared to global memory:
\begin{equation}
N_{Mgpu} = (N_{load,p} + N_{store,p}) N_{part} + N_{store,pix} N_{pix}^2,
\end{equation}
where $N_{load,p}$ and $N_{store,p}$ are the number of loads and stores of individual 
particles, and $N_{store,pix}$ is the number of stores of rendered images (no loads 
are expected since images are created on the GPU). 
Furthermore, memory access overheads can be estimated as $N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem}$. $N_{Ngpu}$ is the overall number of memory accesses and $\nu_{mem}$ represents memory frequency. The overall times required for moving data among memories are thus calculated by:
\begin{equation}\label{tmgpu}
\begin{split}
T_{Mgpu} = {(N_{load,p} + N_{store,p}) N_{part} S_{part}
+ 12 N_{store,pix} N_{pix}^2\over \mu_{gpu}} + \\
+ N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem} + g_{GPU},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{gpu}$ is the global memory bandwidth
and $g_{GPU}$ the time 
spent on memory accesses by GPU specific functions. Equation \eqref{tmgpu} indicates that performances related to global-shared memory data transfers depend on $N_{load,p}$, $N_{store,p}$ - these quantify amounts of data transferred from global to shared memories and vice-versa. Achieved performances depend on memory bandwidth.

An optimal solution would be to realize a single data transfer only
(i.e. $N_{load,p} = 1$ and $N_{store,p} = 0$) with each thread processing a different particle fully. Such an approach ({\it one-thread-per-particle}) would guarantee optimal exploitation of GPU architectures. Nevertheless this is not practical, the main reason being that frequent race conditions may arise, i.e. threads attempting to concurrently update identical pixels in the rendered images.
Only our {\it Rasterization} kernel is data parallel and can thus implement fully the {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach - in fact particles are processed independently. Consequently $N_{load,p} = 1$ and since processed particles must be copied back to the global memory to be rendered $N_{store,p} = 1$. The {\it Rendering} kernel is envisaged to require an additional data load, but no more store 
stages are necessary (particles can be ``forgotten'' once their contribution is calculated).

For very large-scale datasets, the images size gives a meaningful contribution to $T_{Mgpu}$ only if the number of active particles (particles falling in the field of view, see Figure~\ref{fig:fov}) is of the same order of (or smaller than) the number of pixels. This can happen for specific camera settings.

A critical term in equation \eqref{tmgpu} is represented by the memory access
latency $N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem}$. The access to memory is slow in comparison to
the available bandwidth, so a small number of accesses, $N_{Ngpu}$, is crucial
to performance. This can be achieved by standard caching strategies, that
however are effective only if data coalesced access (in particular data contiguity) can be guaranteed, i.e. if contiguous particle data moved to the GPU L2 cache can be reused efficiently
by the various threads. This is possible only through a global reorganization 
of the particle data, which has to be designed ensuring that no significant overheads are introduced and  
that overall linear scalability with the number of particles is preserved.

\section{CUDA Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Once particles are loaded into the GPU's global memory, the {\it Rasterization} kernel starts processing them. We can follow an efficient {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach, so that the entire computation on individual particles (e.g. geometric transformation and coloring) is carried out by single threads - no interaction with any other processes is necessary. This allows exploiting the underlying GPU architecture fully. Subsequently the {\it Rendering} kernel takes over. As explained previously (see Section~\ref{sec:model}) we cannot adopt a {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach. Moreover memory usage must be managed carefully.

To handle particles in an efficient way we observe that depending upon their radius ($r(p)$) as defined by equation \eqref{radius} rendering can be performed differently. As an example, as particles with a small radius typically influence single pixels on the rendered images, we can process these by deploying a {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach (see Section~\ref{sec:smallparticles}). On the other hand, particles with very large radius affect sizeable areas of the rendered images, so these are not suitable for efficient GPU processing (see Section~\ref{sec:largeparticles}). Finally, particles with radius within a suitably defined range influence only small fractions of the rendered images, so we process these by using a highly-efficient tiling strategy (see Section~\ref{sec:regularparticles})

We classify particles in three categories (in the {\it Rasterization} kernel) according to their radius using two empirically-defined threshold values (0.5 and $r_0 \sim 0.01 N_{pix}$) as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{\it Small (S)} : $r(p) \le 0.5$,
\item
{\it Regular (R)} : $0.5 < r(p) \le r_0$ and
\item
{\it Large (L)} : $r(p) > r_0$.
\end{itemize}

According to our tests (see Section~\ref{sec:results}) the impact of this classification process on overall performances in negligible.
%MARZIA- CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE ON THIS, I.E. GIVE SOME QUANTIFICATION OF THE WORD NEGLIGIBLE
Each particle is labeled
with a {\it tile index} $i(p)$ as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
$i(p) = -2$, {\it non-active} particles (i.e. outside the field of view);
\item
$i(p) = N$, {\it small} particles;
\item
$0 \le i(p) < N$, {\it regular} particles;  
\item
$i(p) = -1$, {\it large} particles.
\end{itemize}

Regular particles are typically centered on tiles generated by subdividing rendered images as follows:

\begin{equation}
N_t = {N_{pix}^2\over t_x \times t_y},  
\end{equation}
%MARZIA PLEASE CHECK THE LEFT HAND SIDE TERM OF THIS EQUATION, IS IT N OR NT?

where $t_x$ and $t_y$ are the sizes of tile sides in pixels. Although these parameters are set empirically ($t_x=t_y=12$), they can be customized as necessary, e.g. for performance tuning. An example of particle classification from different points of view is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fov}.

Subsequent to classification we remove from the device memory all inactive and large particles. At this point, the remaining particles have to be sorted by the $i(p)$ key and the number of particles with the same index has to be calculated.
%At the end of this operation, all particles with the same tile index are contiguous in memory,
%providing an optimal memory access pattern and can be easily isolated for tiles assignment and processing.
%A specific kernel has been developed to implement these operations.
This sorting operation is important as it allows to manage particles on the device and it is necessary for the efficient execution of subsequent operations, e.g. reduction by key and prefix sums. Memory accesses to the elements involved in a CUDA operation are coalesced when all of them are consecutives.
% MARZIA THIS LAST SENTENCE NEEDS REPHRASING IF IT IS TO MAKE SENSE TO UNFAMILIAR READERS

As sorting is intrinsically an expensive operation we use an efficient implementation provided by the Thrust library \cite{thrusturl}. Thrust is a C++ template library for CUDA which mimics the Standard Template Library and provides optimized functions for managing very large data arrays. For our purposes, Thrust implements a highly optimized Radix Sort algorithm for primitive types (e.g., chars, ints, floats, and doubles). Also, functions are provided for reduction by key and prefix sums, their performance increasing the larger the input data arrays. As these functions scale linearly with data sizes (sorting scales by $kN_{part}$, where $k$ is the number of significant key bits \cite{RadixSort}), our GPU implementation preserves Splotch's overall linear dependency on the number of input particles. The sections below describe the rendering details for individual classes ({\it small}, {\it regular}, {\it large}) of particles.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{images/fov.eps}
\caption{The scene with five particles from two different points of view. Different tiles are
represented with different colors. In the first camera position
(left) all particles contributes to the image (lie in the FOV), particles 2 and 3
being classified as C2, particle 4 being C3 and particle 5 being C2. Particle 1, is classified
as C2, since it is completely contained in a {\it Btile} (in this example, it is a tile with a boundary of 3 pixels width). In the right
image the camera moved toward particle 1. All the radii change due to the new point
of view. Classification of particles 4 and 5 does not change, while particle 3
becomes inactive (completely falling outside the FOV). Particle 2, though
having coordinates outside the FOV, affects some pixels, hence it is still active.
Particle 1 becomes C1, since its radius exceeds the boundary width, so it exits the Btile.
}
\label{fig:fov}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Small Particles}
\label{sec:smallparticles}
Only the position of individual particles within rendered images has to be calculated. This can be efficiently carried out by assigning CUDA threads to particles. However, since different threads can affect the same pixel in the rendered images, their contribution (fragments) cannot be directly accumulated. We thus firstly we allocate a buffer (index buffer) in the device memory to store particle positions. Secondly, the image is produced by reducing by key (pixel id) all fragments - these are equal to the colour associated to particles from rasterization. Particles are sorted by pixel id followed by reducing contiguous elements falling on the identical pixels using functions from the Thrust library.

\subsection{Regular Particles}
\label{sec:regularparticles}
Our \textit{tiling scheme} for rendering regular particles on the device consists of assigning particles related to the same image tile to a block of CUDA threads and exploiting the shared memory and thread synchronization within the block to store and compose image tiles. The local size of the tile is defined so that each particle belonging to it, is entirely contained within the tile. This is achieved by adding to the $body$ of the tile of $t_x \times t_y$ pixels a $boundary$ of $r_0$ pixels around it (see Figure~\ref{fig:fov}). We will refer to this extended tile as a \textit{Btile}.

Particles are accessed in chunks of $n_p$ elements. Each chunk is accessed and stored in the shared memory by a single read operation, performed simultaneously by all (or almost all) %MARZIA PLEASE EXPLAIN - WHAT DOES IT MEAN ALMOST ALL?
the threads of the block. Then, the particles of the chunk are rendered sequentially, each with a single parallel operation so that each pixel of the particle is processed by a different thread of the block (the pixel number processed by each thread may change as the particle varies, but it remains in the Btile).
This solution avoids race conditions when composing the image tile, since each
thread of the same block accesses different pixels. Moreover the workload of each
thread is almost the same even if particles have different sizes. %MARZIA PLEASE SAY SOMETHING TO FULLY JUSTIFY THIS

When all particles of the block are rendered, the contribution of the Btile
is added to the image stored in the global memory.
Specific care has been taken to avoid missing contributions coming
from overlapping regions (boundaries). Since CUDA blocks are order independent, three more copies of the image in the global memory are necessary to store corners, rows and columns of the boundary respectively without race conditions. The final rendered image is then obtained by executing a follow up kernel compositing these copies.

\subsection{Large Particles}
\label{sec:largeparticles}
These particles are the most challenging to process as their large
radius prevents the usage both of a tiles based solution and of a fragment buffer.
In the first case, tiles would be too large to be stored in the shared memory
and, in any case, their large overlap could lead to strong overheads in the composition of the
final image. Using a fragment buffer instead would require too much memory, since
for each particle a large number of fragments would be generated, possibly
larger than the available memory. Our solution to these problems is to copy these particles back to the CPU and performing their rendering
using the serial version of Splotch. This is possible thanks to CUDA asynchronous
operations, which allow to copy data from the device to the host (and vice-versa)
whilst the calculation on the GPU is on-going. Once the particles are back on the CPU,
their processing can be performed concurrently to that of the GPU.  
This way, we manage to exploit both the host and the device simultaneously, avoiding the difficulties related to the rendering of large
particles. This solution is effective as long as the number of large particles
is much smaller than the sum of small and regular particles. As a worst case scenario (although highly unlikely in practise), if all particles are classified as large, the overall performance would degenerate to that of the serial implementation of Splotch.

\subsection{Discussion}
For both small and regular particles the main drawback of the proposed solutions
is represented by the overhead associated with the sorting and reduction operations. In particular the sorting
is intrinsically time-consuming, requiring intensive memory usage.
The performance of the approach for rendering regular particles is also influenced
by the size of the shared memory, which limits the number of resident blocks
per multiprocessor during the execution of the kernel, thus reducing the theoretical
%CLA: trattare da qualche parte il load balancing
occupancy (see Section~\ref{sec:gpuperf})).
%A further issue is related to the
%unbalanced work load of each block. In fact the number of particles falling
%in each tile can vary in a significant way from one tile to another.
%All these aspect will be quantitatively analyzed in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
For large particles, a limiting factor is related to the management of the index buffer, but this is negligible because its size is much smaller than the particle array.
%MARZIA- SAY SOMETHING HERE TO QUANTIFY THE TERM NEGLIGIBLE
Once all calculations are completed the two partial images (one processed by the GPU the other by the CPU) ae composed to generate the final rendered images. Such operation is performed by the CPU, once the GPU partial image has been transferred, with a single copy operation, to its memory. This data transfer has no impact on the overall performance, involving just a few MBs. The same observation holds true for the reduction of the two partial images.

\section{Tests and results}
\label{sec:results}
We have analyzed the performance of Splotch's GPU implementation in a number of cases, designed in 
order to stress the different features of the algorithm, 
comparing the results 
obtained using the GPU to those obtained with the original code on the CPU. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/box.eps}
\caption{The simulated box, visualized by Splotch. White dots represent stars and galaxies, while the 
diffused blue component is the gas.}
\label{fig:box}
\end{figure}

The dataset adopted in all the tests is the result of a medium sized cosmological 
N-body simulation performed using the Gadget code \cite{gadgeturl}. It consists in about 
400 million particles, with about 200 million of dark matter particles, the same amount 
of baryonic matter (herafter ``gas'') and about 10 million star particles. 
All particles are characterized by their spatial coordinates, velocities
and smoothing length. 
Both the gas and the stars have a number of other quantities associated, that can be used 
as color and intensity. Mass density and temperature for the former, spectral type and age
for the latter. Dark matter is not used in our tests. Figure~\ref{fig:box} shows 
the entire data cube visualized by Splotch.

The large size of the dataset, $\approx 7.5$ GB, can be handled only by a large memory computing node. 
This is not an issue for the GPU, since data are split 
in smaller chunks and loaded iteratively on the accelerator. 

Our tests have all been performed on a dual-socket six-cores Intel Xeon 5650 processor,
running at 2.6 GHz, with 24 GB of shared memory 
each equipped with two NVIDIA Tesla X2090 GPU with 6 GB of GDDR5 memory,
177 GB/sec main memory bandwidth, 665 GFlops/sec of peak performance. GCC 4.4.6 and CUDA 5.0 
were used for the code compilation.

\subsection{GPU performance tuning}
\label{sec:gpuperf}
In order to get high performance on the GPGPUs, an important aspect is the occupancy (i.e. exploit the underlying architecture as much as possibile trying to avoid that some core is idle during the kernel execution).
From an algorithmic point of view, it is strictly related to the number of threads per block, the number of registers and the size of shared memory used in the kernel because they define the number of resident CUDA blocks (blocks/SM) during the execution. 
Therefore it is important to find a good trade-off among these factors in order to achieve a high occupancy. 

In our implementation, the Rendering kernel is the most critical in this sense. This kernel uses a significat part of the shared memory because each block stores here the Btile and a number $n_p$ of particles to be rendered. 
Hence $n_p$, the tile side $t_x$ (for simplicity we set $t_x=t_y$) and its boundary width $r_0$ are parameters that must be carefully tuned. 
Since $r_0$ is critical both for the particle classification and the CUDA block size, we cannot reduce it as much as we like (we suggest to set $r_0=6$ or $r_0=8$), therefore our tests were focused on finding the best configuration for $n_p$ and $t_x$ which are mainly related to the amount of shared memory used and quite independent of the image resolution. Notice that the tile side is also relevant to the load balancing among different blocks: as the tile side decreases the work load is less unbalanced. However this problem cannot completely overcome when the dataset distribution is heterogenous at all scales. Therefore a further investigation must be done for this issue.

Some possible configurations for these two parameters and the corresponding algorithm performance are presented in Table~\ref{tab:tuning}. In our tests the boundary width and the image resolution are fixed so that the amount of particles processed by the device is always the same. The rendering time includes the computation for all the types of particles (the host contribution is completely overlapped by the device because we have considered a test case were most of the particles are processed by the GPU). Since the tile size affects other computation parts of the code (e.g. particle distribution among tiles), we also consider the total CUDA time as a performance index of the rendering algorithm. 
The necessity to store the Btile and a fixed number of particles in the shared memory for an efficient access to the global memory, do not allow us to reach a full occupancy of the board for the execution of the rendering kernel: the maximum real occupancy obtained is $66.7\%$ both for $n_p = 64$ and $n_p=32$. However the best performance is obtained when $n_p=64$ and $t_x = 12$, which is the configuration used in the following tests.

\end{table}

\subsection{Performance analysis}
\label{sec:performance}
The main tests' parameters are the data size ($N_{part}$),
the image size ($N_{pix}^2$) and the distribution of the number of pixels 
per particle ($r(p)$) and its expectation value $R_s$.

\medskip
\noindent 
{\bf Scalability with data size}

\noindent
A first series of tests analyze the scalability of the code
with the size of the processed dataset. In these tests, both the image size
and the camera position are kept fixed and set so that all the particles are processed 
by the GPU.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/scalan.eps}
\caption{Scalability of different Splotch's kernels on the GPU with the dataset size.}
\label{fig:scalability}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:scalability} shows different timings, progressively increasing the number of particles
from about $10^7$ up to the total size of about $2.2\times 10^8$. 
The overall computing time scales linearly, 
confirming that the the GPU code preserves the linear dependency from the 
number of particles. 
The Rasterization time always represent 
a minor contribution to the overall time, resulting approximately ibetween the 5 and the 10\% of the processing 
time. For the original serial implementation, this ratio varies between the 35\% and the 60\%.
This proves that the {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach adopted for this kernel
is extremely effective, making its impact on computing time almost negligible.
The ``Rendering'' time 
is due to the proper rendering kernel. It shows a perfect linear scalability
with $N_{part}$ and represents one of the two main contributions
to the computing time, the other being the sum of the overheads related to all those 
parts specific to the GPU code refactoring 
(e.g. host-device copy time, particle classification etc.). 
This overhead  will be discussed in detail later in this section.

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Scalability with radii and comparison with the CPU}

\noindent
The smoothing radius depends both on the intrinsic properties of the particle
and from the camera position. 
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:model} , this has a big impact 
on the implementation of the GPU rendering kernel and
on the performance. In order to investigate the dependency of the performance from
the smoothing radii, we have performed a number of tests (seven test)
setting the camera (i.e. the point of view) progressively closer to the dataset center. 
The first camera position was chosen so that the data cube lies inside the image; the second was set so that the cube fits exactly the size of the image. Then the camera position is closer and closer the box center. Figure~\ref{fig:panorama} shows the images created by Splotch at the different radii.
The image size is kept constant in all the tests, with $N_{pix}$=1000.
 
Approaching the center of the 
data cube, the radii distribution moves to larger values. This is 
shown in figre Figure~\ref{fig:radii} and expressed synthetically 
by the average $R_s$ radius, whose values, for the different cases, are presented in 
Table~\ref{tab:radius}, together with the corresponding number of active particles and computing time.

\end{table}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/panorama.eps}
\caption{The particle distribution rendered by Splotch at different camera positions: from very 
far from (top-left image), to very close to the dataset center.}
\label{fig:panorama}
\end{figure}

The measured total computing time changes according
to the number of active particle, that decreases approaching the center of the particle 
distribution, and the radius $R_s$, that progressively increases. At values of 
$R_s$ larger than unity, a relevant fraction of the particles has radii comparable to the image size
contributing to a large number of pixels, so increasing the computing time 
with the square of their radius. The two opposite trends tend to compensate, keeping  
the computing time between 19 and 28 seconds.

The same tests have been carried out also with the original Splotch code, exploiting the OpenMP parallel capabilities (see Appendix A for details) to run on 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 processors, in order 
to compare the performance of the two different implementations. The OpenMP was preferred to the MPI parallel implementation being its design closer to that of the CUDA version. The results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:radii}. 
Since the number of processed particles depends on
the camera position, we use the  
computing time per particle as a performance
indicator. The curve shows a bi-modal behaviour. For small $R_s$,
the computing time is almost constant, since the performance is dominated
by $N_{part}$ term, which is substantially constant in that range of 
radii. For values of $R_s$ larger 
than unity, the dependency from the square of the radius dominates and the computing time 
rises quickly. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/scalaomp.eps}
\caption{GPU and CPU performance at different radii. Black line represents the GPU 
computing time, blue lines the CPU times from 16 cores (light blue) to 1 core
(dark blue).}
\label{fig:gpucpu}
\end{figure}

The comparison between the GPU and the multicore performance show that 
at small radii ($R_s < 2$) the speed-up of the GPU version (defined as the ratio between the CPU and the GPU times) can be larger than a factor of 6, compared to a single CPU. If we consider the parallel implementation, it is interesting to note that in this range of radii, GPU performance is comparable to that obtained from 8 cores. This is because parallel codes do not scale linearly with the number of processors. At radii $R_s > 2$ the performance of the CUDA implementation tends to decrease, due to the larger number of particles processed by the CPU. Even in the worst case scenario, however, the GPU version is faster than the single core (see next section for further details). 

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf GPU timing breakdown}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/speedup.eps}
\caption{
Speed-up of the Rendering and Rasterization kernels, defined as the ratio

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/over1.eps}
\caption{Overhead of the various components implemented for the Splotch's
GPU refactoring. The ratio between the time spent in each component and the total processing 
time is shown.}
\label{fig:over}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The same tests presented above, run at different $R_s$, are used also to
analyze the 
time spent in the different kernels. First, we discuss the performance 
achieved by the kernels present also in the original Splotch code: Rasterization and
Rendering.
This is followed by the analysis of the  
{\it GPU overheads}, that is the time spent by functions specific
to the GPU implementation, that are not present in the original code. Such functions can 
be identified as those to offload data to the GPU (Offload),
to sort and reduce data for tiles preparation and memory displacement optimization (Sort),
to remove non active particles and to pack and copy back particles that have to 
be rendered by the CPU (Select) and, finally,
to combine the Btiles in the final image and to setup the GPU environment.

In Figure~\ref{fig:speedup} we compare the time needed by the Rasterization and Rendering
kernels on the GPU and the CPU. The speed-up is defined as the ratio between these two
quantities. For the rendering kernel, a maximum speed-up around 13 is obtained for
average radii around the unity. For smaller radii the speed-up tends to decrease due 
to the lower occupancy of the C2 particles rendering kernel which reduce the efficiency of the GPU.
%CLA MARZIA check carefully the previous statement please!!!
As the radius grows, the performance drops, due to the increasing number of particles
processed by the CPU.    

Due to the {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach, the Rasterization kernel is strongly
accelerated by the GPU. The estimated speed-up, ranges between 45 and 65, 
%CLA why ???

Figure~\ref{fig:over} presents the overhead of the different GPU specific functions
in terms of fractional time, defined as the time spent by the function devided by
the overall computing time. The black line shows the total overhead fractional time. 
This can be up to the 60\% of the processing time and it is particularly relevant
for small radii, where most of the particles are active and the sort and reduce 
function (blue line with crosses) gives a relevant contribution. This becomes negligible
at large values of $R_s$, where most of the particles are inactive. 
The red line represents the offload time which is constant in all the tests (all the
particles are moved to the GPU irrespectively to the camera position) and contributes for
about the 15\% to the overhead time. The fractional contribution tends to decrease at larger radii
due to the increase in the overall processing time. In principle, this overhead could
be strongly reduced adopting CUDA streams and overlapping data copy to
computation. However, this is currently prevented from the adoption of
Thrust libraries, that, in its current version, does not support asynchronous operations. Furthermore,
in some situations, when the CPU workload is larger than that of
the GPU (e.g. at large radii), such solution would be anyway ineffective. 
The Select time contribution to the overhead is  slighlty higher than that of Offload 
This tends to decrease at larger radii, when more particles are moved 
back to the CPU, hence coalesced memory access can be effectively adopted. 
Finally, setup time and image composition always give a negligible contribution and 
are not displayed in the figure. 
In particular, the image combine time accounts for approximately 0.1\% of 
the GPU overhead. This is due mainly to the efficient design of the 
algorithm, which takes full advantage of the multi-thread architecture 
of the accelerator. 

\section{Conclusions and Next Steps}
\label{sec:conclusions}
The CUDA implementation of Splotch allows to exploit GPUs 
for the visualization of huge data volumes, such those produced both 
by experiments/observations and by computer simulations. Current trends
in HPC envisage the adoption of accelerators to substantially 
increase the performance of the computing systems, maintaining the power
consumption reasonably low. However, accelerators, and in particular 
GPUs, requires a certain effort to be efficiently exploited, 
supporting only peculiar programming models, that requires codes, or part
of them, to be redesigned and reimplemented before being suitable to such devices. 

Splotch proved to be a challenging application to enable to GPUs. 
In fact, the main computational kernel, the Rendering kernel, poses serious difficulties
to the GPU's programming model, that privileges highly data parallel algorithms.
In order to overcome such difficulties, Splotch's rendering algorithm has been
redesigned with the introduction of specific kernels. These kernels 
introduce an overhead that can be up to the 50\% the overall computing
time. Nevertheless, the final code overperforms the original CPU
version of up to a factor of 4-5, which rises to a factor of 8 when the OpenMP,
multithread parallel version is considered for comparison. Further optimization can
be obtained by the adoption of CUDA streams, overlapping computation 
and data movements. However this is currently prevented by the usage of the 
Thrust libraries, that do not support such kind of operational mode. 
The Splotch GPU code retains also two important features of the original
code: the linear scalability with the number of particles and with the 
image size. 

Although not extraordinary, the attained GPU performance is sufficient 
to run efficiently on the hybrid computing nodes that are more and 
more common in the HPC framework. In order to fully exploit such architectures, 
a further step is necessary, supporting the concurrent usage of 
multiple GPUs, multiple cores and multiple nodes, exploiting respectively the OpenMP and
MPI capabilities of Splotch. This step is expected to pose important 
challenges especially to find the optimal balance in the workload of each of the different 
system components.
