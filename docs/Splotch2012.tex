\section{Introduction}

The management and analysis of data generated by scientific experiments, 
observations and numerical simulations, currently represent an extraordinary challenge  
both for the research teams who concurred to its production and for 
the data centers, that have to provide technical solutions in terms of 
storage, computing power and software.

The main challenges are due both to the data size, aggregate but also of each 
single dataset, and to its complexity, useful information being hidden in a sea 
of bits. Standard data mining and analysis software often relies on complex
algorithms, that become prohibitively computationally expensive when dealing with 
huge datasets. Visual data exploration and discovery can represent a valuable
support, since they provide a prompt and intuitive insight to
very large-scale data sets to identify regions and/or features of interest within which
to apply time-consuming algorithms. 
Furthermore, this apporoach can be an extremely effective and ready way of discovering 
and understanding correlations,
similarities and data patterns, or to identify anomalus behaviors, that can be
interpreted as a wrong result, avoiding to waist time and effort on the specific dataset or
to save resources in an on-going experiment (e.g. stop a simulation that is producing 
unreliable outputs). Finally, visualization is also an effective means of presenting
scientific results both to experts and to general public.

In order to visualize huge datasets, suitable tools must be available, able to 
exploit High Performance Computing (hereafter HPC) devices, like multicore, multinode
supercomputers, providing suitable resources in terms of computing power, memory size, 
storage capacity and performance and network speed. Currently, not many such tools are avilable.

In this paper we focus on {\it Splotch} REF, our previously developed ray-casting
algorithm. Splotch was born for an effective high performance visualization of large-scale 
astrophysical data sets coming from particle-based computer simulations. The software is 
specialized in the high-quality, high-performance rendering of point like data as those 
produced in cosmology by N-Body numerical experiments, which 
represent prime examples of particle-based simulations. We can mention 
the Millennium ``trilogy'', the Horizon run or the DEUS simulation (REF) ETC., which
represent the most advanced and largest simulations in the field. 
This models reproduce the evolution of a meaningful fraction
of the universe by means of hundreds billion fluid elements, represented as particles,
interacting with each other through gravitational
forces. The typical size of a output (``snapshot'') of these simulations spans from several hundreds 
of Gigabytes up to tens of Terabytes, and typically stores the
ID, position and velocity together with additional properties, e.g.
local smoothing length, density and velocity dispersion, of each particle.

Splotch however, has been successfully adopted also in other application fields,
like the visualization of real galaxy systems, whose 3D shape is carefully modeled
according to observational data. Here, more than the data size, the driver is
the quality and the level of details of the final images,
that have to reproduce the full details of the
spectacular data coming from astronomical observations (REF in preparation). Furthermore,
it has been adopted also for the visualization of meshed based astrophysical simulations, 
although the same high quality cannot be achieved unless extremely high resolution
meshes are provided. 

In the development of Splotch, specific care has been taken of all the performance 
issues. The software is optimized in order to require the minimum possible
memory usage and in order to exploit vector architectures, multi-core processors 
and multi-nodes supercomputers (REF). 

In the last years, 
GPUs, and their computational counterpart, GPGPUs, have 
acquired more and more popularity both in the graphics and in the HPC 
communities, since they can provide extraordinary performances on suitable
classes of algorithms, with speed-up factors of about one order of magintude with respect to 
a standard multicore CPU and with a comparable power consumption.
Therefore, on HPC systems, graphic accelerators are becoming more and more common. 
Many supercomputers are equipped with hundreds of GPUs that can overlap 
their computing power to that of the CPUs, strongly reducing the time-to-solution
of many typical scientifc problems.

In order to exploit this additional computing resources, we have implemented 
a GPU version of Splotch. A full refactoring of the code has been necessary 
to get the good performance out of the GPU's implementation. 
All the details are presented in the rest of the paper. In Section 2, we give a short 
overview of the Splotch main algorithms. In Section 3, we recap the main features
of the GPU architecture and the CUDA progemming model
and we present the performance model that drove the 
re-design of the code. In Section 4 
we describe the implemented algorithm. Section 5 shows
the results of the performed tests and benchmarks. Finally, in Section 6, we draw 
the conclusions. 

\section{Splotch overview}

The main peculiarities of the Splotch software are represented by the 
high quality of the generated images, obtained adopting a specialized ray-casting 
approach, its high performance, due to a strong optimization on HPC architectures and the exploitation of multi-core, multi-node 
systems by means of an effective mix of the OpenMP and MPI parallel programming paradigms, and
the support of large data volumes, through an optimal usage of the memory, with
no data replica or unnecassary allocations, a full 64 bits support and the exploitation
of both shared and distributed memory systems. Furthermore, Splotch's design is kept 
intentionally simple, making its extension to new components and functionalities easy. 
Finally, the software package is completely self-contained, with no dependencies from external 
libraries (apart from those needed for parallelism and HDF5 - REF - for
specific input data file formats). The code is fully C++ and its compilation
usually straightforward, as soon as a suitable makefile script is provided.
No configure procedure is currently supported. The software is fully open source and 
can be obtained in its most recent version contacting the authors.

The Splotch algorithm operational scenario consists of a number of stages. 
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\it Data load}: data is read from one or more data files. A number of different file
formats are supported, from raw binaries, to HDF5 to more specific Gadget (REF) or Tipsy (REF)
files. The $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates are the only compulsory quantities to provide.
These can be cartesian geometric coordinates, but also any other tern 
of variables, adopted to explore a generic three dimensional parameter space.
\item
{\it Rasterization and Processing}: particle coordinates and other geometric quantities 
(like smoothing lengths, see below) are roto-translated and projected according to the 
camera configuration (camera position, look-at direction and orientation). 
Active particles (that actually contributes to the image according to the point of view)
are identified. Active data is normalized, necessary 
transformation (e.g. calculations of logarithms of processed quantities) are performed
and RGB colors (according to read data or to a given
external color table) are associated to each data point. For simplicity, in the rest 
of the paper we will refer to this part of the code as {\it Rasterization} algorithm.
\item
{\it Rendering}: particles contribution to image pixels are calculated.
\item
Image save: final images are saved using the TGA format.
\end{itemize}
The workflow is shown in figure~\ref{fig:workflow}, where the parts of the algorithm parallelized
either with MPI or with OpenMP are emphasized. For a detailed description of
the hybrid parallel implementation of Splotch and its performances, we refer to REF.
In the same figure, also the parts subject to the GPU implementation are shown, 
anticipating the discussion of the following sections.

\end{figure}

The most peculiar part of the Splotch software is represented by its ray-casting algorithm.
This is also its most computationally demanding component.
In order to effectively handle point-like distributions, the following 
steps are carried out: 

\begin{itemize}
\item
the particle $p$ with coordinates $\vec r$ transports a quantity $\rho_p(\vec r)$ 
(e.g. the mass density or the temperature at position $\vec r$)
that modulates the contribution of the specific particle to the image
according to the following gaussian distribution: 

\begin{equation}\label{smooth}
\rho_p(\vec r)=\rho_{0,p}\exp(-r^2/\sigma_p^2),
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_p$ is the smoothing length, which represents
a sort of size of each particle.  
In principle, each data point contributes to all the pixels of the final image.
In practice, it is much more handy to have a compact support of the
distribution, that is, the distribution is set to zero at a given
distance $f\cdot\sigma_p$, where $f$ is a proper multiplicative factor.
Therefore rays passing
the particle at a distance larger than $f\cdot\sigma_p$ are
unaffected by $\rho_p$.

\item
Three ``frequencies'' to describe the red, green and blue
components of the radiation, respectively, are used. These are treated independently.

\item
The radiation intensity $\bf{I}$ (treated
as a vector with r, g and b components) along a ray through the simulation
volume is modeled by the well known radiative transfer equation
\begin{equation}\label{rad}
\frac{d\bf{I}(x)}{dx}=(\bf{E}_p-\bf{A}_p\bf{I}(x))\rho_p(x),
\end{equation}
which can be found in standard textbooks REF.
Here, $\bf{E}_p$ and $\bf{A}_p$ describe the strength of radiation emission and absorption
for a given particle for the three rgb-colour components. 
%In general it is recommended to
%set $\bf{E}_p=\bf{A}_p$, which typically produces visually appealing images. This is presently a
%necessary setting for Splotch, in order to reduce the complexity of some aspects of its parallel
%implementation. This constraint will be eliminated in the next releases of the code.
If a scalar quantity is chosen (e.g.\ the particle temperature,
density, velocity dispersion, etc.), the mapping to the three components of $\bf{E}$ and $\bf{A}$ (for red, green and blue)
is typically achieved via a transfer function, realized by a colour look-up table or palette, which can
be provided to the ray-tracer as an external file to allow a maximum of flexibility. If a
vector quantity is chosen (e.g.\ velocity, magnetic field, etc.), the three components of the vectors
can be mapped to the three components of $\bf{E}$ and $\bf{A}$ (for red, green and blue). 
In addition
to the color, the optical depth of each particle can be also modulated proportionally to another
scalar property (e.g.\ density, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\section{The GPU Code}

GPUs represent an efficient tool to improve the performances of a numerical code.
However, algorithms have to be reimplemented in order to run on the accelerator. 
Often, a complete redesign is necessary to achieve good performace and in many
cases such performance is much lower than the nominal one. Nevertheless, even in 
the case of moderate performance improvements, a GPU enabled code allows the 
user to exploit the full power of the majority of the HPC systems currently 
available, which combine usual multicore procesors with multiple graphic accelerators.

Splotch has undergone such refactoring process, adopting the CUDA paradigm 
for an effective usage of the GPU. The basic steps accomplished in
the realization of the GPU code, are presented in the next sections. 

%GPUs can represent an effective tool for Splotch to dramatically 
%reduce the time-to-solution and to step toward real-time interaction.
%However, the real effectiveness of GPUs on Splotch rastering algorithm has to
%be carefully analysed and estimated. Splotch, in fact, poses serious challenges 
%to the GPU's programming model, that privileges highly data parallel algorithms 
%where the hundreds of cores of the GPU can work independently from each other.
%Any kind of dependency is strongly penalized, reflecting on the final performance.
%Splotch, however, violates this basic requirement in the following aspect:
%each particle can affect a different number of pixels, depending both on its intrinsic
%smoothing radius and on the camera position (the same particle 
%can affect none or all the pixels of an image, depending on the point of view). 
%Hence, an optimal load balancing can be hard to achieve 
%and, even worse, it can lead to frequent concurrent accesses to memory, since
%different threads acting on different particles may affect the same pixel,
%leading to wrong results.
%
%The potential dependency of any pixel of the image from any data point,
%makes the distribution of work between GPU's cores challenging to implement
%and even harder to tune in terms both of performances and of memory requirements.
%In section XXX, we propose a simple performance model that has
%driven the implementation of the GPU enabled Splotch kernels.

\subsection{The CUDA programming model} 

For the implementation of the GPU code we have adopted the CUDA programming model (REF). 
This is currently the standard ``de facto'' for GPU programming.
Its main drawback is represented by the limited portability, being an NVIDIA product. However,
this ensures that the CUDA programming model closely maps and supports the underlying
hardware (NVIDIA cards), leading to an optimal tuning of the performance.
The CUDA standard offers access to highly parallelized modern GPU architectures via a simplified C/C++ or Fortran language interface. It is designed to support joint CPU/GPU execution of an application, where serial sections are performed by the CPU (host), while those which exhibit rich amount of data parallelism, are performed by the GPU (device) as CUDA kernels. The CPU and the GPU have separate memory spaces so data must be transferred from each other via PCI Express bus (REF - hereafter PCI-E). 
CUDA kernels launch is asynchronous, so that the host can
 perform the following instructions of the code while the device is computing. If one of them requires the completion 
of the kernel execution, then it is necessary to call the \textit{cudaThreadSyncrhonize}() function before executing it.
A kernel is written for a single thread and instantiated as a grid of many lightweight parallel threads, organized into blocks of the same size. A thread is an indipendent element of work and maps to a hardware core. A block is a 1D, 2D or 3D set of concurrently executing threads that can cooperate among themselves through barrier synchronization and ``fast'' shared memory. 
This is possible because threads belonging to the same block are executed on the same multiprocessor (SM). On the other hand
 synchronization is not possible between blocks of a grid. In fact, the limited amount of memory limits the number of 
blocks that can simultaneously reside in the same SM. Moreover when one block stalls the runtime system switch to 
a different one, hence there is no guaranteed order of execution.

Once a block is assigned to a SM, it is partitioned into 32-thread units called warps. They are scheduling units in SM:
all threads in a same warp execute the same instruction (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread). Hence, programmers should minimize the number of execution branches inside the same warp. It is convenient to assign a large number of warps to each SM (i.e. high occupancy), because the long waiting time of some warp instructions is hidden by executing instructions from other warps  and therefore the selection of ready warps for execution does not introduce any idle time into the execution timeline (zero-overhead thread scheduling). Further details on CUDA can be found in (REF).

\subsection{Performance model and analysis}

Splotch's main computational kernels are the {\it Rasterization}, 
{\it Rendering}, {\it Image Creation}, composition and save of 
the final image. The initial data load phase, though often demanding, will not be treated
here since it is not subject to the GPU implementation.

%The main parameters of the model are $N_{part}$, the number of particles
%to be processed, and $N_{pix}$, the number of pixels of the final image
%(in general we can consider square images with $N_{pix}=N_{pix}^2$). For 
%the Splotch's rendering kernel a third parameter must be introduced, 
%that is the average smoothing length of the particles,
%$R_s$. Its value depends both on the intrinsic "size" of the particle
%and on the position of the point of view (particle size increases getting closer to 
%the point of view).
%
%The kernels scale with these parameters as:
%\begin{align}\label{scaling}
%& N_{Norm} \propto N_{part},\\
%& N_{Geom} \propto N_{part},\\
%& N_{Color} \propto N_{part},\\
%%& N_{Sort} \propto N_{part}{\rm log}(N_{part}),\\
%& N_{Render} \propto N_{part} R_s^2,\\
%& N_{Image} \propto N_{pix}^2,
%\end{align}
%where $N_{kernel}$ is the number of operations for a given kernel.

%The Normalization, Geometry and Coloring kernels are  
%perfectly data parallel, each particle being processed independently from the others.
%Thus they are expected to fit the GPU programming model. 
%The Rendering kernel is, in general, the most computationally demanding. 
%The computational time depends in a predictable way with the number of particles and the number 
%of pixels. The most challenging dependecy, however, is from the smoothing length. 
%This dependency leads to strong changes in the computational effort and makes
%the work-load hard to balance, when this is distributed among many-processors
%systems.

In order to model the Splotch algorthm's performances, we split the different timings
required to perform the main computational steps. 
The Splotch's performances can be quantified as time spent on the CPU, time spent on the GPU
and time spent to move data among different memories:
\begin{equation}\label{Ts}
T_{TOT} = T_{cpu} + T_{pci} + T_{gpu} + T_{Mgpu},
\end{equation}
where $T_{TOT}$ is the total time, 
$T_{cpu}$ is the time spent on the CPU, $T_{gpu}$ is the time
spent on the GPU for computation, $T_{pci}$ is the time needed to move data from
the CPU to GPU and back through the PCI-E bus and $T_{Mgpu}$ is the time 
spent in moving data among the global and the shared memory on the GPU.

\noindent$\bullet$ {\bf Data transfers}

Data offload to the GPU is one of the crucial steps in the algorithm. 
The minimum amount of data 
to be moved to the GPU is represented by the particles information 
(coordinates, fields, smoothing length). If $S_{part}$ is the
size of a single particle (in the current implementation $S_{part}=35$ bytes) and 
$N_{part}$ is the number of particles to be processed,
$N_{part} S_{part}$ is the total amount of particle data that has to be moved to the device.
The final processed image (the result) is the only data that has to be copied back to
the CPU. Thus, in principle, only $12 N_{pix}^2$ bytes (R, G, B float values) have to be transferred at
the end of the rendering phase. Here, $N_{pix}$ is the linear resolution in pixel of the 
image (we consider square images, since the generalization to rectangular images is
straightforward). 

Particles' data offload can be accomplished either in a single or in a few operations, 
depending on the data size (if it fits the available GPU memory) and/or
in order to exploit CUDA streams, which allows to overlap communication 
and computation, hiding the data transfer overhead.  
In order to implement this solution data have to be
splitted in chunks and passed to the GPU one after the other, in a loop. Whilst chuncks 
are transferred, computation on previous chuncks, already stored on the GPU
memory, can be carried out. 
The data transfer time can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}\label{pci}
T_{pci} =  N_{chunks} \tau_{pci} + {N_{part} S_{part} + 12 N_{pix}^2 \over 
\mu_{pci}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{pci}$ is the transfer time latency (in seconds) and $\mu_{pci}$ is the
bus bandwidth (in bytes per second), $N_{chunks}$ is the number 
of copy stages. 
Equation $\eqref{pci}$ shows that performance
depends linearly from both the number of particles and the number of pixels.
In the case of large datasets we have that
$N_{part} >> N_{pix}^2$. For instance, the test case adopted
in section XXX consists in $N_{part} \sim 10^8$
and $N_{pix}^2 \sim 10^6$. In such cases, the contribution of $N_{pix}^2$
to $T_{pci}$ is negligible.

Splitting data in sub-chunks does not
cause any meaningful overhead if the copy latency is kept small, that is:
\begin{equation}
N_{chunks} < {N_{part} S_{part}\over \tau_{pci}\mu_{pci}}.
\end{equation}
For instance, if $N_{part}$ is $O(10^8)$, $N_{chunks}$ can be up to $10^5$ before
contributing to the overhead.

Equations $\eqref{pci}$ considers only the main data tranfers of
the Splotch's algorithm. However, further data tranfers may be necessary.
This aspect will be treated in section XXX.

\noindent$\bullet$ {\bf GPU computation}

The time spent in processing the particles on the GPU can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
T_{gpu} = N_{op}/\nu_{GPU},
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{GPU}$ is the GPU flops/sec rate and
\begin{equation}\label{ops}
N_{op} = N_{part}(\alpha + \gamma R_s^2) + f_{GPU},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ estimating the number of operation of 
the Rasterization kernel  
and of the Rendering kernel respectively. The function 
$f_{GPU}$ takes into account any GPU specific kernel (i.e. a kernel
which is not present in the original code, necessary to the GPU implementation). 

The parameter $R_s$ is the most peculiar dependency of the Splotch's rendering
algorithm. It is defined as the expectation value of the particles radii:
$R_s = <r_s(p)>$, where
\begin{equation}\label{radius}
r_s(p) = A(p){\chi \sigma_p\over S_{box}} N_{pix},
\end{equation} 
$A(p)$ being the function to tranform to image coordinates,
$\chi$ a proper factor defining the compact support size (see  
equation \eqref{smooth}) and $S_{box}$ being the computational box size.
The particle radius depends both from the intrinsic properties of the particle
and from the camera position. The same particle can have a negligible size
from one point of view and it can affect the whole image from a different one.
On the other hand, particles close to each other can have different radii depending
on their intrinsic characteristics. The dependency from $r_s(p)$ poses 
two major problems to the GPU implementation of the rendering 
algorithm. First, two threads acting on different particles could try 
to update the same pixel.
This can cause frequent concurrent accesses to memory
which lead to wrong results, with the correcteness and quality of the resulting image 
degraded if not completely compromised.
Second, different particles can require very different workload, affecting 
a differnt number of pixels. Therefore, a good load balancing
between threads is very hard to achieve.  
Specific solution must be designed to circumvent such difficulties 
without paying big penalties in terms of performance (as would happen, for instance,
adopting atomic updates, supported by CUDA, but too slow to be used for continuous 
updates of the pixels values).

Finally, it is interesting to stress that $T_{gpu}$ depends linearly from the number of particles. 
This feature should be preserved by the GPU implementation, so the term 
$f_{GPU}$ does not have to introduce any higher order dependency from $N_{part}$. 

\noindent$\bullet$ {\bf Memory accesses}

Global-shared memory data transfers can be estimated 
as the number of loads from the global to the shared memories of the available 
streaming multiprocessors plus the number of stores from the shared to the global memory: 
\begin{equation}
N_{Mgpu} = (N_{load,p} + N_{store,p}) N_{part} + N_{store,pix} N_{pix}^2,
\end{equation}
where $N_{load,p}$ and $N_{store,p}$ are the number of load and store of the 
particles, while $N_{store,pix}$ is the number of stores of the image (no loads 
are expected, since the image is created on the GPU). 
Furthermore, memory access overhead can be estimated as $N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem}$,
where $N_{Ngpu}$ is the total amount of memory accesses, $\nu_{mem}$
is the memory frequency. 
Hence, the time for moving data among memories is:
\begin{equation}\label{tmgpu}
T_{Mgpu} = {(N_{load,p} + N_{store,p}) N_{part} S_{part}
+ 12 N_{store,pix} N_{pix}^2\over \mu_{gpu}}
+ N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem} + g_{GPU},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{gpu}$ is the global memory bandwidth
and $g_{GPU}$ the time 
spent on memory accesses by the GPU specific
functions, corresponding to the $f_{GPU}$ term in equation \eqref{ops}.
The terms $f_{GPU}$ and $g_{GPU}$ will be the subject of section XXX.

Equation \eqref{tmgpu} shows that the performance related to global-shared memory 
data transfers
depends on the two parameters $N_{load,p}$ and $N_{store,p}$, that quantify the
total amount of data transferred from the global to the shared memories 
and back, whose performance depends on the memory bandwidth.
The optimal solution would be to have only a single data transfer
($N_{load,p} = 1$ and $N_{store,p} = 0$), with each thread
fully processing a different particle. This {\it one thread per particle} solution guarantees
the best exploitation of the GPU architecture.
This solution, though ideal, is not practical, the main reason being the frequent race conditions
rising from threads trying to concurrently update the same pixels.
Only part of the algorithm is data parallel and can adopt the {\it one thread per particle}
approach. This corresponds to the Rasterization kernel, in which each particle
is processed independently from the others, thus
$N_{load,p} = 1$ and, since processed particles
have to be copied back to the global memory to be rendered, $N_{store,p} = 1$.

The rendering part requires a futher particle data load step, while no more store 
stages are necessary.

The $T_{Mgpu}$ term depends linearly from the image size. Once more, 
for large datasets, this term appears to be negligible. However, since
particles falling outside the field of view are not processed (``inactive'' particles),
depending on the camera position, it can give a meaningful contribution to
the computing time.

A critical term of equation \eqref{tmgpu} is represented by the memory access
latency $N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem}$. The access to memory is slow in comparison to
the available bandwidth, so a small number of accesses, $N_{Ngpu}$, is crucial
to the performance. This can be achieved by standard caching strategies, that
however are effective only if data contiguity is guaranteed. In other words,
if contiguous particle data moved to the GPU L2 cache can be reused efficiently
by the various threads. This is possible only through a global reorganization 
of the particle data. Such reorganization can however lead to an important
working and memory usage overhead, contributing to the terms $f_{GPU}$ and
$g_{GPU}$ respectively. 

Any other memory access specific to the GPU implementation algorithm,
accounted by the term $g_{GPU}$, must be implemented 
avoiding the introduction of eccessive overheads and preserving the overall
linear scalability with the number of particles.

\noindent$\bullet$ {\bf CPU computation}

The final contribution to equation \eqref{Ts} is $T_{cpu}$. In principle this should be negligible, 
the large part of the work being performed by the GPU. Actually, the CPU
can contribute to process a suitable fraction of the particles. Using
CUDA asyncronous operations this work can be overlapped 
to the GPU work, accounting for a fraction of the work needed to 
process the final image.

\section{The CUDA implementation}

As soon as data is loaded in the global memory of the GPU, each particle is processed 
by the Rasterization kernel.
As described above, this kernel can adopt an efficient  
{\it one-thread-per-particle} approach, with full exploitation of
the GPU architecture. 
After Rasterization, particles are ready to be rendered (Rendering kernel).
As explained in section XXX,
for the Rendering stage, a simple {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach
cannot be adopted. Furthermore, memory usage must be carefully optimized. 

\subsection{Rendering algorithm design}

On the GPU, the rendering algorithm has been designed according to the following procedure.

Particles are first classified in 3 groups according to their size:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
C1: $r_s > r_0$
\item
C2: $0.5 < r_s \le r_0$
\item
C3: $r_s \le 0.5$
\end{itemize}
where $r_s$ is the particle radius in pixels defined by equation \eqref{radius}.

Particles of different classes pose different challenges to the rendering 
algorithm and are processed with different approaches. Particles of class C3 
influence a single pixel, therefore they can be efficiently 
processed with a ``one-thread-per-particle" approach. Setting $r_0 \sim 0.01 N_{pix}$, 
particles of class C2 can influence only small fractions of the image. If 
we divide the image in ``tiles" of suitable size, each C2 particle can affect 
only one tile (see below for details). Finally, particles of class C1 can affect 
a large fraction of the image, spanning multiple tiles.

The particle classification is added to the Rasterization kernel, with negligible impact
on the computing effort. Each particle is labeled
with a {\it tile index} $n_c$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$n_c = -2$, inactive particle (outside the field of view);
\item
$n_c = -1$, if it belongs to C1 class; 
\item
$0 < n_c < N_t$, if it belongs to C2 class and its centre falls in the $n$-th tile of the image;  
\item
$n_c = N_t$, if it belongs to C3 class, i.e. is point-like.
\end{itemize}
The parameter $N_t$ is the number of tiles the image is divided in. It is defined as
\begin{equation}
N_t = {N_{pix}^2\over (2r_0)^2}.   
\end{equation}

%CLA I PROSSIMI TRE CAPOVERSI VANNO MIGLIORATI E COMPLETATI

After this operation, a new kernel has to be implemented.
Within this kernel particles are sorted by the $n_c$ key and the number 
of particles with the same index is calculated. At the end of this operation, 
all particles with the same tile index are contiguous in memory, 
providing an optimal memory access pattern. Furthermore, they can be easily 
isolated for different kinds of processing and for tiles assignment.

The sorting operation plays a crucial role. It allows to manage particles on the 
device and it is necessary for the efficient execution of further operations like 
reduction and prefix sum by key. In fact, memory accesses to the elements involved 
in a CUDA operation are optimized when all of them are consecutives. However, sorting 
is intrinsically an expensive operation. Hence, an efficient CUDA implementation of
the sorting function has to be adopted in order to reduce its overhead. 
The Thrust library (REF) provides such function. Thrust is a C++ template library 
for CUDA which mimics the Standard Template Library (STL) and provides 
optimized functions to manage very large arrays of data. In particular, Thrust 
implements a highly-optimized Radix Sort algorithm (REF) for sorting primitive types
(e.g., char, int, float, and double) with the standard less comparison operator and 
apply dynamic optimizations to further improve its performance.
Thrust functions provide also an effective solution to........

All these functions scale linearly with the data size (actually the sort scale as...),
preserving, in practice, the linear dependency of the algorithm with $N_{part}$.


The \textit{tiling scheme} for rendering C2 particles on the device consist in 
assigning particles related to the same image tile to a block of CUDA threads 
and exploit the shared memory and thread synchronization within the block to store 
and compose the image tile. The tile side size is set so that any particle 
belonging to the tile is entirely contained in it. This is achieved by 
defining a $body$ of the tail of $2r_0$ pixels and $edges$ of $r_0$ pixels on each side 
of the tile (see figure XXX). 
We will refer to this extended tile as a \textit{Btile}).
Particles are accessed in chunks of YYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  by thread 0 of each block and stored 
in the shared memory so that all threads of the same block can access their data. 
Then each pixel of the current particle is rendered by a different thread of 
the block (the pixel number processed by each thread may change as the 
particle varies, but it remains in the Btile). 
This solution avoids race conditions when composing the image tile, since each 
thread of the same block accesses different pixels and the workload of each thread 
(except thread 0) is the same even if particles may have different size.

When all particles of the block are rendered, the contribution of the Btile 
is added to the image stored in the global memory. 
Specific care has been taken in avoiding losing contributions coming 
from overlapping regions (edges and corners).

Rendering of C3 particles simpler, since they are affect a single pixel. 
Thus, only the position of the particle in the global image has to be calculated.
This can be efficiently carried out by assigning a CUDA thread to each C3 particle. 
However, since different threads can affect the same pixel, their contribution (fragment) 
cannot be directly added to the image. Hence, this is done in a second step by allocating 
in the device memory one buffer (fragment buffer) to storing fragments and
corresponding index ids. Finally, the image is produced by reducing by key (pixel id) the 
fragments. This consists in a sort of the fragments by key, followed by the reduce of 
contiguous elements falling in the same pixels, using the corresponding 
functions provided by the Thrust library.

For both C2 and C3 particles the main drawback of the proposed solutions 
is represented by the overhead due to the sorting and reduction operations.
%CLA: QUA CI VUOLE QUALCHE COMMENTO IN PIU'
Performances of the C2 particles rendering algorithm are also influenced 
by the size of the shared memory, which limits the number of resident blocks
per multiprocessor during the execution of the kernel, thus reducing the theoretical
occupancy. A further issue is related to the
unbalanced work load of each block. In fact the number of particles falling
in each tile can vary in a significant way from one tile to another. 
For C3 particles, a limiting factor is related to the size of the fragment buffer,
that cannot exceed the free memory space. This, however, can be 
easily overcome by splitting the proccessing in a number of iterations suitable 
to the amount of available memory.  
All these aspect will be quantitatively analyzed in section XXX.

Particles of class C1 are the most challenging to process. Their large 
radius prevents the usage both of a tiles based solution and of a fragment buffer.
In the first case, tiles would be too large to be stored in the shared memory
and, in all cases, their large overlap could lead to strong overheads in the composition of the 
final image. A fragment buffer instead could require too much memory, since 
for each C1 particle a great number of fragments would be generated, possibly
larger than the available memory. The adopted solution circumvented these 
difficulties by copying C1 particles back to the CPU and perform the rendering 
with the original, serial algorithm. This is possible thanks to CUDA asynchronous
operations, which allows to copy data from the device to the host (and vice-versa)
whilst the calculation on the GPU proceeds. Once C1 data are back on the CPU, 
their processing can be performed concurrently to that of the GPU.  
With this approach, we manage to exploit both the host and device
at the same time, hiding the difficulties related to the rendering of ``big"
particles. This solution is effective as long as the number of C1 particles 
is much smaller than that of particles belonging to the other two classes. 
In the worst case, all the particles would be C1 and the time to solution would be slightly 
longer than that of the pure sequential code. 

The final step is the composition of the two partial images (one processed by the
GPU the other by the CPU) into the final result. 
Such operation is performed by the CPU, 
once the GPU partial image has been transferred, with a single copy operation, to
its memory. The data transfer has no impact on the performance, involving just a few 
megabytes of data. The same holdes for the reduction of the two partial images.   

\section{Tests and results}

We have analyzed the performances of Splotch's GPU implementation in a number of cases, designed in 
order to stress the different features of the algorithm, presented in the previous 
sections, comparing the results 
obtained using the GPU to those obtained with the original code on the CPU. 

The dataset adopted in all the tests is the result of a medium sized cosmological 
N-body simulation performed using the Gadget code (REF). It consists in about 
400 million particles, with about 200 million of dark matter particles, the same amount 
of baryonic matter (herafter ``gas'') and about 10 million star particles. 
All particles are characterized by their spatial coordinates, velocities
and smoothing length. 
Both the gas and the stars have a number of other quantities associated, that can be used 
as color and intensity. Mass density and temperature for the former, spectral type and YYYYYY
for the latter. Dark matter is not used in our tests. Figure XXX shows 
the entire data cube visualized by Splotch.

The large size of the dataset, $\approx 7.5$ GB can be handled only by a large memory computing node. 
This is not an issue for the GPU, since data are splitted 
in smaller chunks and loaded iteratively on the accelerator. 

Our tests have all been performed on a 16-core AMD Opteron 6272 2.1 GHz Interlagos processor,
with 32 GBytes of memory, equipped with one NVIDIA Tesla X2090 GPU with 6 GB of GDDR5 memory,
177 GB/sec 
main memory bandwidth, 665 GFlops/sec of peak performance. GCC 4.3.4 and CUDA 5.0.20 
were used for the code compilation.

\subsection{Performance analysis}

The main tests' parameters are the data size ($N_{part}$),
the image size ($N_{pix}^2$) and the distribution of the number of pixels 
per particle ($r_s(p)$) and its expectation value $R_s$.

\noindent$\bullet$ {\bf Scalability with particles and image size}

A first series of tests are dedicated to analyze the scalability of the code
with the size of the processed dataset. In these tests, both the image size
and the camera position are kept fixed and set so that all the particles are processed 
by the GPU.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/scalability.jpg}
\caption{Scalability of Splotch on the GPU with the dataset size}
\label{fig:scalability}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:scalability} shows different timings, progressively increasing the number of particles
from about $10^7$ up to the total size of about $2.2\times 10^8$. 
The overall computing time scales linearly, 
confirming that the the GPU code preserves the linear dependency from the 
number of particles. 
The Rasterization time always represent 
a minor contribution to the overall time, resulting approximately the 10\% of the rendering 
time. For the original serial implementation, this ratio varies between the 35 and the 60\%.
This proves that the {\it one thread per particle} adopted for this kernel
is extremely effecctive, making this part of the algorithm almost negligible
for the performance.
The ``Rendering'' time 
is due to the proper rendering kernel. It shows a perfect linear scalability
with $N_{part}$ and it represents one of the two main contributions
to the computing time, the other being the sum of the overheads related to all those 
parts specific to GPU code refactoring. These parts are represented by 
the host-device copy time, the particle classification, the host and reduce procedure 
and the image recompose kernel (see section XXXX). 
In the current implementation, this overhead is
the main contribution to the computing time and 
it is strongly affected by the PCI Express copy time. 
%CLA: IL PROSSIMO CAPOVERSO NON SO SE METTERLO
Figure XXX shows the ratio 
of the data transfer time to the dataset size. In some cases, the copy time can be 
up to the 60% of the estimated overhead. An asynchronous implementation of 
the algorithm can therefore pull down such overhead, as shown in figure XXX by
the ``Async'' curve, further improving the achieved GPU performance.  
 
The dependency of the code from the image size is presented in figure XXX..... 

TO BE COMPLETED 

\noindent$\bullet$ {\bf Scalability with radii and comparison with the CPU}

The smoothing radius depends both on the intrinsic properties of the particle
and from the camera position. 
As discussed in section XXX, this has a big impact 
on the implementation of the GPU rendering kernel and
on the performances. In order to investigate the dependency of the performances from
the smoothing radii, we have permorformed a number of tests progressively 
positioning the camera closer to the dataset center. The particles radii distribution for each
camera position is presented in figure XXX. Approaching the center of the 
data cube, the radii distribution moves to larger values. This is quantified 
by the average $R_s$ radius, whose values, for the different cases, are presented in 
table XXX, togheter with the corresponding number of active particles 
(i.e. particles lying in the field of view) and computing time. 
Figure~\ref{fig:panorama} show the images created by splotch at the different radii.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{Images/panorama.jpg}
\caption{The particle distribution rendered by Splotch at different radii}
\label{fig:panorama}
\end{figure}

The same tests have been carried out also with the original Splotch code, in order 
to compare the performances of the two different implementations. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/Rs.jpg}
\caption{Scalability of different components with the radius}
\label{fig:Rs}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{fig:Rs}, we present the scalability of the GPU code 
with $R_s$. Since the number of particles processed depends on
the camera position (particles outside the field of view are not rendered), 
the processing time per particle is used as a meaningful performance
indicator. The curve shows a bi-modal behaviour. For small $R_s$,
the computing time is almost constant, since the performance is dominated
by $N_{part}$ term, which is substantially constant. For values of $R_s$ larger 
than unity, the dependency from the square of the radius dominates and the computing time 
rises quickly. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/gpucpu.jpg}
\caption{Comparison of GPU and CPU performances at different radii}
\label{fig:gpucpu}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:gpucpu} presents the comparison between the GPU and the CPU computing time
in the seven cases under investigation, using 
1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 cores, exploiting the Splotch's OpenMP (REF) parallel
capability, so that the GPU performances can be directly compared to
those achievable on a multicore, multithreads configuration.
This test allows to get an indication of the actual hardware configuration
needed, in the different cases, to get performances similar to those
obtained with the GPU. The simple comparison with a single core would provide 
just an approximate hint, since parallel codes never scale linearly with
the number of processors. 

The figure shows how the GPU's performance is 
comparable to that obtained by 8 cores, for radii smaller
than unity. For the same tests, the GPU is from 4 to 5 times faster than the single 
core. As $R_s$ grows, more and more particles are renderized by the CPU, hence 
the performance deteriorates, becoming progressively comparable to that
of 4 and 2 cores. However, even in
the worst case, there is some advantage in using the GPU, since
due to the Rasterization stage and since part of the particles 
remains small enough to be rendered by the accelerator.
