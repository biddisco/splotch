\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%CLAUDIO: I REMOVED ALL THE REFERENCES HERE SINCE THE SUBJECT IS TOO GENERIC AND BROAD. WE SHOULD CITE HUNDREDS OF PAPER.
The management and analysis of modern large-scale datasets generated by scientific experiments and numerical simulations can be very challenging due to continuously increasing sizes and complexity~\cite{DataTsunami}. Traditional data mining and analysis methods often rely on computationally complex
algorithms which can be very expensive if employed for 
large-scale datasets. Visual exploration and discovery can then represent invaluable tools, e.g. by providing scientists with prompt and intuitive insights enabling them to identify interesting characteristics and thus define regions of interest within which
to apply time-consuming methods. Additionally, they can be a very effective way in discovering and understanding correlations in data patterns, or in identifying unexpected behaviours, thus saving valuable resources, e.g. by terminating promptly on going numerical simulations producing unreliable results. Visual exploration and discovery tools can also provide effective means for communicating scientific results not only to researchers but also to members of the general public. The reader is referred to~\cite{DAV} for a recent discussion on visualization and data analysis challenges to be addressed for next-generation large-scale datasets.

Astrophysics represents a prime example of a scientific field where visual data analysis and exploration is not just useful, but in some cases, mandatory. Often, in fact, no automated algorithmic solutions exist to identify and characterize features without requiring human assessment for correct interpretation. For this reason the astrophysical community has a long tradition in developing and deploying visual discovery tools for their datasets typically represented by images, complex surveys, data cubes or N-body simulations. Astrophysics thus represents an ideal discipline for exploiting High Performance Computing (HPC) devices, e.g. large multi-core and multi-node systems, providing all necessary resources for coping with large-scale datasets, e.g. computational power, large memory sizes, sufficient storage capacities and fast network speeds. A recent example is given by Hassan et al. (see related works and references in~\cite{2012ASPC..461...45H}), who focus on forthcoming generations of radio surveys (ASKAP~\cite{askap} and SKA~\cite{ska}), which are expected to produce very large datasets. Visual discovery tools can play a crucial role in exploring data cubes through a mesh-based volume rendering approach boosted by the efficient usage of GPUs. A further example, is given by Fraedrich et al. \cite{Fraedrich:2009:TMV}, who
investigated scalability in visualizing large-scale particle-based cosmological 
simulations focusing on the Millennium run \cite{millennium}, and presented methods to reduce the associated limitations on PC architectures based on levels-of-detail.
Recently Kaheler et al. \cite{2012arXiv1208.3206K} presented an algorithm specifically designed for N-body simulations. Their approach is based on a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain with mesh vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions and offers several GPU-assisted rendering solutions. This article includes an excellent review of methods for particle based visualization (see \cite{2012arXiv1208.3206K} for details).

A number of popular, open-source software packages attempt to address the challenges associated with large-scale datasets and exploitation of HPC devices, e.g. VisIt~\cite{visit} and Paraview~\cite{paraview}. Both are based on VTK~\cite{vtk} and support a fairly large variety of data types, file formats and visual discovery solutions. They can be used either as stand alone tools locally or in a client-server configuration. Both tools support in-situ visualization~\cite{in-situ} allowing visualization procedures to be embedded in a simulation, thus generating images during a run (i.e. no data files are required) and enabling computational steering. A recent application of ParaView to large-scale cosmological simulations can be found in \cite{2011ApJS..195...11W}. Neither of these packages provides customised tools for astrophysics,  e.g. particle visualization capabilities are limited. Often the underlying computational performances and/or memory usage are not highly optimized, thus preventing effective deployment of these packages on modern, large-scale astrophysical datasets. Another VTK-based open-source software package focusing on astrophysics is VisIVO~\cite{visivo}. Although its main limitation is lack of interactivity, it has been recently released in the form of a science gateway offering a web-based, workflow-enabled framework seamlessly integrating large-scale, multi-dimensional datasets and applications for processing and visualization by exploiting distributed computing infrastructures \cite{VisIVOGateway}. Advanced users are able to create, change, invoke, and monitor workflows while standard users are provided with customized web interfaces hiding all underlying technical aspects. Tipsy \cite{tipsyurl}, Splash \cite{splash}, GLnemo \cite{glnemo} and Partiview \cite{partiview} are further examples of software packages specifically designed for particle-based datasets. Applicability of these packages to large-scale datasets is limited as they operate in stand-alone mode without support for HPC resources.

This paper concentrates on {\it Splotch} \cite{2008NJPh...10l5006D} which is a ray-casting algorithm for effectively visualizing large-scale, particle-based numerical simulations. Very high-quality visualisations can be generated by Splotch for modern large-scale cosmological simulations, e.g. the Millennium trilogy \cite{millennium}, the Horizon and MareNostrum runs \cite{horizon} or the DEUS simulation \cite{deus}. The underlying models in these simulations typically reproduce the evolution of a representative fraction of the universe by means of hundreds of billions of fluid elements (represented as particles), interacting through gravitational forces. The typical size of a time output (or {\it snapshot}) employed by Splotch can range from several hundreds of GigaBytes (GBs) to tens of TeraBytes (TBs), recording ID, position and velocity of particles together with additional properties, e.g. local smoothing length, density and velocity dispersion. Although developed for numerical simulations, Splotch has being successfully employed 
also in other contexts, e.g. for visualizations of real galaxy systems \cite{m83-vis}.

%that have to reproduce the full details and the
%spectacular features of astronomical objects. Furthermore,
%it was adopted also for the visualization of meshed based astrophysical simulations
%(although the same high quality cannot be achieved unless extremely high resolution
%meshes are provided).
The original Splotch algorithm has been optimized in terms of memory usage and exploitation of standard HPC architectures, e.g. multi-core processors and multi-node supercomputing systems by adopting the MPI paradigm \cite{jin:high-performance} and OpenMP (see Section~2).

Nowadays HPC systems are increasingly populated with GPUs employed not just as graphic accelerators but also as computational co-processors providing, on suitable classes of algorithms, outstanding performances with power consumption being comparable to standard CPUs. Supercomputers are thus increasingly equipped with several hundreds of GPUs that can overlap their computing capability with that of CPUs, minimising considerably overall times-to-solution of high-end scientific problems. This article discusses the issues we faced in designing and implementing a new version of Splotch using the CUDA paradigm \cite{cudaurl} to fully exploit modern HPC infrastructures. The main issue was optimizing rendering of variable radius particles, dependent both on their intrinsic size and on the point of view, posing several problems for the GPU computation in terms of race conditions and workload balancing. A preliminary investigation, as reported in \cite{jin:high-performance}, had to be redesigned from the ground up to significantly improve performances. A number of optimized solutions for rendering particles have been implemented, based on a novel data classification and organization strategy. Furthermore, the Thrust library \cite{thrusturl} was adopted for an optimal implementation of specific kernels requiring sorting or reduce-by-key operations.
%CLAUDIO: I WOULD NOT PUT THIS HERE
%Our approach can accelerate the original Splotch up to a factor of 6, when compared to a single core, and 
%can give performance comparable to that of 8 cores using the shared memory parallel model. 
This improved performance is achieved without affecting the performance features of the original Splotch, namely linear scalability on the number of particles. 
Section~2 is a short description of Splotch. The CUDA paradigm and a performance model that guided our re-designing of Splotch are discussed in Section~3. Our implementation is presented in Section~4 in which we describe our strategy on how to classify particles for rendering. Section~5 presents our reference datasets for benchmarking and discusses performance results including scalability related to sizes of datasets and smoothing radius. Finally Section~6 presents conclusions and pointers to future developments.

\section{Splotch Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

Splotch generates high-quality images through a customised ray-casting approach, described in detail in \cite{2008NJPh...10l5006D}.  
The implementation of Splotch is self-contained with no dependencies from external libraries (apart of course from those needed for parallelism and to support specific file formats, e.g. HDF5 \cite{hdf5}). The code is pure C++ and can be compiled through suitable makefile scripts.
%The current implementation of Splotch \cite{} adheres to a simple software engineering design allowing for easy extensions, e.g. incorporating new data readers. 
The main stages of Splotch are summarised below:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\it Data Loading} - Several readers are available supporting numerous formats. At least three scalars are required representing particle coordinates in a user-defined coordinate system.
\item
{\it Processing and Rasterization} - Normalization together with other necessary 
calculations (e.g. for logarithms of processed quantities) are performed. Particle
coordinates and other geometric quantities (such as smoothing lengths - see below) are
roto-translated and projected according to camera settings.
Active particles (i.e. contributing to the final rendering) are identified and assigned with RGB color components. For simplicity this stage will henceforth be referred to as {\it Rasterization}.
\item
{\it Rendering} - The contributions of individual particles to the final rendering are calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation  \cite{1991par..book.....S} along lines of sight originating from each pixel:
\begin{equation}\label{rad}
\frac{d{\bf I}{(\bf x})}{dx}=({\bf E}_p-{\bf A}_p{\bf I}({\bf x}))\rho_p({\bf x}),
\end{equation}
where ${\bf I}({\bf x})$ represents radiation intensity at position ${\bf x}$, $x$ corresponds to a coordinate along lines of sight,  ${\bf E}_p$ and ${\bf A}_p$ are the coefficients of radiation emission and absorption of particle $p$ respectively and $\rho_{0,p}({\bf x})$ is a physical quantity (e.g. mass density or temperature) transported by particle $p$ according to a Gaussian distribution:
\begin{equation}\label{kernel}
\rho_p({\bf x}) = \rho_{0,p}\exp(-{||{\bf x}-{\bf x}_p||}^2/\sigma_p^2).
\end{equation}
 
%begin{equation}\label{smooth}
%\rho({\bf x}) = \sum_{p=1}^{N_{part}} \rho_p W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi),
%\end{equation}
%where $\rho_p$ is a discrete field transported by particles (e.g. mass density or temperature), and $W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi)$ is a smoothing kernel defined as:
%\begin{equation}\label{kernel}
%W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi) = \exp(-r_p^2/\sigma_p^2)\qquad {\rm for}\quad  r<\chi\sigma_p,
%\end{equation}
%and
%\begin{equation}\label{kernel1}
%W(r_p,\sigma_p,\chi) = 0 \qquad {\rm for}\quad r>\chi\sigma_p,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$r=\vert {\bf x_p}-{\bf x} \vert$ is the distance of the particle $p$ with coordinates ${\bf x_p}$ from ${\bf x}$ and $\sigma_p$ is a smoothing length defining a compact support for the Gaussian distribution. 
where ${\bf x}_p$ denotes particle coordinates. This distribution is zero at a given distance $\chi\cdot\sigma_p$, 
where $\chi$ is a suitably-defined multiplicative factor and $\sigma_p$ is the particle smoothing length. Any rays passing at distances larger than $\chi\cdot\sigma_p$ are unaffected by $\rho_p$. Visually appealing renderings are produced by using ${\bf E}_p = {\bf A}_p$. Futhermore, in this case, the calculation is independent of the integration order of particles, allowing a simplified parallel implementation of the algorithm. Nevertheless for special applications independent emission and absorption coefficients can be used. These coefficients
can vary between particles and are typically chosen as a function of a characteristic
particle property (e.g. temperature or density).
%For most of astrophysical applications, where matter density is usually extremely low, the equation can be solved in the {\it optically thin} regime, where the absorption and emission terms are independent of particles. 
%can be neglected. 
%This makes the calculation independent of integration order of particles, allowing a simplified parallel implementations of the algorithm, without affecting the rendering quality and the correctedness of the images. 
Equation \eqref{rad} is solved for each color component (R, G and B) separately. These components can be defined based on relevant physical quantities, e.g. for velocity $\bf v$$=(v_x, v_y, v_z)$ we assign $\rho_p^{R}=v_x$, $\rho_p^{G}=v_y$ and $\rho_p^{B}=v_z$. Conversely, a scalar quantity, such as mass density or temperature, can be mapped to RGB components via look-up tables (or palettes). 
\end{itemize}
Large-scale datasets are supported by exploiting HPC architectures by means of an effective mix of OpenMP / MPI parallel programming paradigms. The MPI implementation in~\cite{jin:high-performance}  simply distributes chunks of particles among several tasks, each performing a serial computation and producing a partial rendering, the root processor composing final renderings. The OpenMP implementation~\cite{Reinecke}
% CHECK THE REFERENCE...
performs {\it Rasterization} exploiting several threads each working on different subchunks of particles. Regarding {\it Rendering}, images are subdivided into tiles (e.g. $100 \times 100$ pixels) which are processed by OpenMP threads on a "first-come, first-serve" basis. To determine the particles to be considered for individual tiles the entire particle array is processed prior to rendering, so that for each tile a list of particle indices is generated.

\section{GPU Considerations}
\label{sec:gpu-code}

Splotch has been realized on modern GPUs by exploiting the CUDA programming paradigm. This section reviews the fundamentals of CUDA programming and introduces details of a performance model we developed to guide the code refactoring discussed in Section~4.  

\subsection{CUDA Paradigm} 
\label{sec:cuda}

The CUDA programming model \cite{cudaurl} by NVIDIA currently represents the standard ``de facto'' for GPU programming. The underlying GPUs are closely mapped leading to optimal performances. The obvious drawback of limited portability is somewhat mitigated by the diffusion of NVIDIA GPUs. Access to highly parallelized modern GPU architectures is offered through a simplified C/C++ or Fortran API supporting joint CPU/GPU execution. Serial procedures are performed by the CPU (host), while those which exhibit rich amount of data parallelism are performed by the GPU (device) realized as CUDA kernels. The CPU and GPU have their own memory space so any data transfers must utilise the PCI Express bus (for simplicity hereafter referred to as PCI-E). 

The launch of CUDA kernels is asynchronous allowing the host to execute code instructions while the device is computing. If the host requires a kernel execution to be completed then it is necessary to call a device synchronization function. A kernel is instantiated as a grid of lightweight parallel threads organized into {\em blocks} of the same size. A thread represents an independent work element and maps to a hardware core or streaming processor (SP). A block is a 1D, 2D or 3D set of concurrently executing threads that can cooperate among themselves via barrier synchronization and fast shared memory. This is possible because threads belonging to the same block are executed on the same streaming multiprocessor (SM). However synchronization is not possible between blocks. The limited amount of memory limits the number of  blocks that can reside in a particular SM simultaneously. Moreover if the execution of a block stalls, the runtime system switches to a different block meaning that there is no guaranteed order for block execution.

Once a block is assigned to an SM, it is partitioned into 32-thread units called {\em warps}. All threads belonging to a particular warp are scheduled to execute the same instruction (Single-Instruction, Multiple-Thread). To optimise overall performance programmers should thus avoid completely (or at least minimize) execution of branches inside warps. Assigning a large number of warps to each SM (high occupancy) is also beneficial as potentially long waiting times of some warp instructions can be conveniently hidden by executing instructions from other warps and selection of ready warps for execution does not introduce idle times into the overall execution achieving zero-overhead thread scheduling. 

\subsection{Performance Model}
\label{sec:model}

The main computation in Splotch occurs during the stages of {\it Rasterization} and {\it Rendering}.
The overall performance can be quantified as CPU and GPU processing times 
and time spent for performing data transfers among different memories using the following expression:
\begin{equation}\label{Ts}
T_{TOT} = T_{cpu} + T_{pci} + T_{gpu} + T_{Mgpu},
\end{equation}
where $T_{TOT}$ denotes total times, 
$T_{cpu}$ and $T_{gpu}$ represent times spent on the CPU and GPU respectively, $T_{pci}$ are times needed for data transfers from the CPU to GPU and vice-versa via PCI-E, and finally $T_{Mgpu}$ are times required for data transfers between the global and shared memory on the GPU. 

%THIS IS WRONG: Although a class of particles (see our classification strategy described in Section 4.1) is handled by the CPU, their processing times ($T_{cpu}$) are in general negligible compared to $T_{gpu}$, so these are embedded into GPU processing times by using the asynchronous operational mode of CUDA. The main terms of $\eqref{Ts}$ are discussed in more detail in the remainder of this section.

%{\bf CPU Computation}

\subsubsection{Data Transfers}
Let us denote by $S_{part}$ the number of bytes required for representing single particles (35 Bytes are used in the current implementation). Assuming an overall number of $N_{part}$ particles, the overall amount of bytes required to be transferred to the GPU is $N_{part} S_{part}$. Additionally the Splotch renderings calculated in the GPU are required to be transferred to the CPU. Assuming square images (generalisation to rectangular images is straightforward) and denoting by $N_{pix}$ horizontal (or vertical) image resolutions, a number of $12 N_{pix}^2$ Bytes (R, G, B float values) has to be transferred. 
Since processor memory is in general larger than GPU memory,
datasets are split into chunks and are transferred to the GPU in a sequence one after the other. The overall data transfer times are:
\begin{equation}\label{pci}
T_{pci} =  N_{chunks} \tau_{pci} + {N_{part} S_{part} + 12 N_{pix}^2 \over 
\mu_{pci}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{pci}$, $\mu_{pci}$ represent transfer time latency and bus bandwidth and $N_{chunks}$ is the number of copy stages. Equation $\eqref{pci}$ shows that performances depend linearly not only on the number of particles but also on the number of image resolution. Assuming very large-scale datasets ($N_{part} >> N_{pix}^2$) the contribution of $N_{pix}^2$ to $T_{pci}$ becomes negligible (as an example see test case described in Section~\ref{sec:results} in which $N_{part} \sim 10^8$
and $N_{pix}^2 \sim 10^6$).

% and depending upon the relevant sizes (i.e. relative to the on board GPU memory) , we can deploy either a single or in a few operations, 
%depending on the data size (if it fits the available GPU memory) and/or
%in order to exploit CUDA streams, which allow to overlap communication 
%and computation, hiding the data transfer overhead. 
Splitting datasets into chunks does not cause any meaningful overheads if the copy latency is small, that is:
\begin{equation}
N_{chunks} < {N_{part} S_{part}\over \tau_{pci}\mu_{pci}}.
\end{equation}
As an example if $N_{part}$ is $O(10^8)$, then $N_{chunks}$ can be up to $10^5$ before
generating any overheads. 
%Data transfers in addition to the ones described by equation $\eqref{pci}$ may be required by Splotch (for details on this aspect see Section~\ref{sec:implementation}).

%{\bf GPU Computation}
\subsubsection{GPU Computation}
%\noindent
The time required for processing particles on the GPU can be estimated by:
\begin{equation}
T_{gpu} = N_{op}/\nu_{GPU}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_{GPU}$ is the GPU's flops/sec rate, and $N_{op}$ is the overall number of operations:
\begin{equation}\label{ops}
N_{op} = N_{part}(\alpha + \beta R_0^2) + f_{GPU},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ representing the number of operations in the \textit{Rasterization} and \textit{Rendering} kernels respectively.

%OPEN
%CLAUDIO: What do you mean in the previous line?
The function $f_{GPU}$ accounts for GPU specific kernels; these are necessary for adapting the original Splotch code to the GPU architecture and optimizing performances. Details of these kernels are discussed in Sections~\ref{sec:implementation} and~\ref{sec:results}.
Finally the parameter $R_0$ encapsulates an expectation value for the radius of particles projected on Splotch renderings $R_0 = <r(p)>$,

\begin{equation}\label{radius}
r(p) = A(p){\chi \sigma_p\over S_{box}} N_{pix},
\end{equation} 
where $A(p)$ is the transformation to screen coordinates, $\chi$ and $\sigma_p$ are defined by equation \eqref{kernel} and $S_{box}$ represents a computational box associated with the particles under consideration. 
The radius of individual particles depends both on their intrinsic properties and on camera settings. Although a particle may exhibit a negligible size from one point of view, it may affect the entire Splotch rendering from another point of view. Also, particles close to each other can have different radius depending on their intrinsic characteristics.

The dependency from $r(p)$ is the source of two major problems for GPU implementations. Firstly, two threads acting on different particles could try 
to update the same screen coordinates (see Figure~\ref{fig:particles}) causing concurrent accesses to memory thus leading to erroneous results. 
Secondly, as different particles may affect different numbers of pixels, it is hard to achieve optimal load balancing among threads.  
Customized solutions must thus be adopted to circumvent the aforementioned problems while avoiding paying large performance penalties. For instance, atomic updates (supported by CUDA) could be adopted for safely updating screen pixels, but this would result in serialization lowering performances. 

To conclude this section we observe that $T_{gpu}$ depends linearly on the number of particles ($N_{part}$). This feature is important to be preserved in a GPU implementation of Splotch.

%\medskip
%\noindent
%{\bf Memory Access}
\subsubsection{Accessing Memory}
%\noindent
Data transfers between global and shared memory can be expressed 
as the sum of the number of GPU's global to shared memory loads plus number of stores from shared to global memory:
\begin{equation}
N_{Mgpu} = (N_{load,p} + N_{store,p}) N_{part} + N_{store,pix} N_{pix}^2,
\end{equation}
where $N_{load,p}$ and $N_{store,p}$ are the number of loads and stores of individual 
particles, and $N_{store,pix}$ is the number of stores of rendered images (no loads 
are expected since images are created on the GPU). 
Furthermore, memory access overheads can be estimated as $N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem}$; $N_{Ngpu}$ is the overall number of memory accesses and $\nu_{mem}$ represents memory frequency. The overall times required for moving data among memories are thus calculated by:
\begin{equation}\label{tmgpu}
\begin{split}
T_{Mgpu} = {(N_{load,p} + N_{store,p}) N_{part} S_{part}
+ 12 N_{store,pix} N_{pix}^2\over \mu_{gpu}} + \\
+ N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem} + g_{GPU},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{gpu}$ is the global memory bandwidth
and $g_{GPU}$ the time 
spent on memory accesses by GPU specific functions. Equation \eqref{tmgpu} shows that performances related to global/shared memory data transfers depend on $N_{load,p}$, $N_{store,p}$ - these quantify the amounts of data transferred. The achieved performances will depend on memory bandwidth.

An optimal solution would be to realize a single data transfer only
(i.e. $N_{load,p} = 1$ and $N_{store,p} = 0$) with each thread processing a different particle fully. Such an approach ({\it one-thread-per-particle}) could guarantee optimal exploitation of GPU architectures. Nevertheless this is not practical, the main reason being that frequent race conditions may arise as discussed already.
Only our {\it Rasterization} kernel is data parallel and can thus implement the {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach. For this stage $N_{load,p} = 1$ and since processed particles must be copied back to the global memory to be rendered $N_{store,p} = 1$. The {\it Rendering} kernel is envisaged to require an additional data load, but no more store 
stages are necessary (particles can be ``forgotten'' once their contribution is calculated).

For very large-scale datasets the size of Splotch renderings gives a meaningful contribution to $T_{Mgpu}$ only if the number of active particles (i.e. particles inside the field of view - see Figure~\ref{fig:fov}) is of the same (or smaller) order relative to screen pixels - this can happen for specific camera settings. A critical term in equation \eqref{tmgpu} is the memory access
latency $N_{Ngpu} \nu_{mem}$. Access to memory is slow compared to
the available bandwidth, so a small number of $N_{Ngpu}$ accesses is critical for achieving high performances. This can be realised by standard caching strategies, that
however are effective only if data coalesced access (i.e. data are accessed by warps in one single memory transaction) can be guaranteed, in particular if consecutive particle data moved to the GPU L2 cache can be reused efficiently by consecutive threads. This is possible only through a global reorganization of the particle data which has to be designed ensuring that no significant overheads are introduced and that overall linear scalability with the number of particles is preserved.

\section{CUDA Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Once particles are loaded into the GPU's global memory, the {\it Rasterization} kernel starts processing them. We can follow an efficient {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach, so that the entire computation on individual particles (e.g. geometric transformation and coloring) is carried out by single threads - no interaction with any other processes is necessary. 
%This allows exploiting the underlying GPU architecture fully. (already stated before!) 
Subsequently the {\it Rendering} kernel takes over. As explained previously (see Section~\ref{sec:model}) we cannot adopt a {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach and memory usage must be managed carefully. To handle particles in an efficient way we observe that depending upon their radius ($r(p)$) as defined by equation \eqref{radius} the rendering process can be performed differently.

Considering particles with a small radius, these typically influence single pixels on the rendered images, so we can process them by deploying a {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach (see Section~\ref{sec:smallparticles}). On the other hand, particles with very large radius affect sizeable areas of the rendered images, so these are not suitable for efficient GPU processing (see Section~\ref{sec:largeparticles}). Finally, particles with radius within a suitably defined range influence only small fractions of the rendered images, so we process these by using a highly-efficient tiling strategy (see Section~\ref{sec:mediumparticles}). We classify particles based on the size of their radius as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{\it Small (S)} : $r(p) \le r_{sml}$,
\item
{\it Medium (M)} : $r_{sml} < r(p) \le r_0$,
\item
{\it Large (L)} : $r(p) > r_0$.
\end{itemize}
where $r_{sml} = 0.5$ so that small particles fall inside single pixels, and 
$r_0$ is set according to an image tiling scheme which divides the rendered images
into a number of tiles as follows:  
\begin{equation}\label{tiles}
N_{tiles} = {N_{pix}^2\over t_x \times t_y},
\end{equation}
where $t_x$ and $t_y$ are parameters defining the sizes of tile sides in pixels.
%Details of the scheme are given in the next sections. 
An example of particle classification from different points of view is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fov}. Each particle is labeled (in the {\it Rasterization} kernel) with a {\it tile index} $i(p)$ which is calculated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$i(p) = -2$, {\it non-active} particles (i.e. outside the field of view);
\item
$i(p) = N_{tiles}$, {\it small} particles;
\item
$0 \le i(p) < N_{tiles}$, {\it medium} particles, whose center falls within the $i(p)$-th tile;
\item
$i(p) = -1$, {\it large} particles.
\end{itemize}

Subsequent to classification we transfer asynchronously all large particles back to the host and remove them from the device memory (at the same time all inactive particles are also removed). At this point, the remaining particles have to be sorted by the $i(p)$ key and the number of particles with the same index has to be calculated.
%At the end of this operation, all particles with the same tile index are contiguous in memory,
%providing an optimal memory access pattern and can be easily isolated for tiles assignment and processing.
%A specific kernel has been developed to implement these operations.
This sorting operation is important as it allows to manage a particles array on the device and it is  
necessary for the efficient execution of subsequent operations, e.g. reduction by key and prefix sums.
%, because memory accesses to the array elements involved in a CUDA operation are efficient when consecutive threads access consecutive elements.
As sorting is intrinsically an expensive operation, we use an efficient implementation provided by the Thrust library \cite{thrusturl}. Thrust is a C++ template library for CUDA which mimics the Standard Template Library and provides optimized functions for managing very large data arrays. For our purposes, Thrust implements a highly optimized Radix Sort algorithm for primitive types (e.g., chars, ints, floats, and doubles). Also, functions are provided for reduction by key and prefix sums for which their performance increases as the input data arrays become larger. As these functions scale linearly with data sizes (sorting scales by $kN_{part}$, where $k$ is the number of significant key bits \cite{RadixSort}), our GPU implementation preserves the original Splotch linear dependency on the number of particles. The sections below describe rendering details for individual classes of particles.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Small Particles}
\label{sec:smallparticles}
To process small particles only their location within rendered images has to be calculated. This can be efficiently carried out by using CUDA threads. However, since different threads can affect common pixels in the rendered images, their contribution (fragments) cannot be directly accumulated. Thus firstly we allocate a buffer (index buffer) in the device memory to store particle positions within the image. Secondly, the rendering is updated by reducing by key (i.e. particle position) all computed fragments - these are equal to the color associated to particles from rasterization - and integrating into screen pixels appropriately.
%Particles are sorted by pixel id followed by reducing contiguous elements falling on the identical pixels using functions from the Thrust library.

\subsection{Medium Particles}
\label{sec:mediumparticles}
Our \textit{tiling scheme} for processing medium particles on the device consists of assigning particles related to the same image tile (as defined by \eqref{tiles}) to a block of CUDA threads and exploiting the shared memory and thread synchronization within the block to store and compose image tiles. The local size of the tile is defined so that each particle belonging to it, is entirely contained within it. This is achieved by adding to the $body$ of the tile of $t_x \times t_y$ pixels a $boundary$ of $r_0$ pixels around it (see Figure~\ref{fig:fov}). We will refer to this extended tile as a \textit{Btile}.

Particles are accessed in chunks of $n_p$ elements. Each chunk is accessed and stored in the shared memory by a single read operation performed simultaneously by the threads of the block. Then, the particles of the chunk are rendered sequentially, each with a single parallel operation so that each pixel affected by a particle is processed by a different thread of the block (although the pixel number processed by each thread may change as the particle varies, it always remains in the Btile). The block dimension is equal to the size of the largest medium particle (i.e.~$4r_0^2$), in order to have enough threads in the block for rendering each pixel influenced by the current particle. 
This solution avoids race conditions when composing image tiles, since each
thread of the same block accesses different pixels. The workload per particle of each
thread is well balanced as each thread processes either one or no pixels at all for each particle, independently of the size of individual particles.

When all particles of the block are rendered, the contribution of the Btile is incorporated to the image stored in global memory. Specific care has been taken to avoid race conditions due to contributions coming
from overlapping regions (boundaries). Since CUDA blocks are order independent, three more copies of the image in the global memory are required to store corners, rows and columns of the boundary respectively. The final rendering is obtained through a kernel compositing these copies. Note that this approach is different compared to the OpenMP implementation, described in Section~2, where large particles are split among different tiles. This solution is not suitable for CUDA because particles falling in several tiles must be replicated for each tile affected by them and thus added to the particles array. For this reason we render on the device only particles entirely contained in tiles extended with suitable boundaries. 

\subsection{Large Particles}
\label{sec:largeparticles}
Large particles are the most challenging to process as their large
radius prevents the usage both of a tiles based solution and of a fragment buffer.
In the first case, tiles would be too large to be stored in the shared memory
and, in any case, their large overlap could lead to strong overheads in the composition of the
final rendering. Using a fragment buffer instead would require too much memory since
for each particle a large number of fragments could be generated, possibly
exceeding in size the overall available memory.

Our solution to these problems is to copy these particles back to the CPU and perform their rendering
using the serial version of Splotch. This is possible thanks to CUDA asynchronous
operations, which allow to copy data from the device to the host (and vice-versa)
whilst the calculation on the GPU is on-going. Once the particles are back to the CPU,
their processing can be performed concurrently to that of the GPU.  
This way, we manage to exploit both the host and the device simultaneously.
This solution is effective as long as the number of large particles
is much smaller than the sum of small and medium particles. As a worst case scenario (although highly unlikely in practice), if all particles are large the performance would degenerate to that of serial Splotch.

Once all calculations are completed two partial images (one processed by the GPU the other by the CPU) are composed to generate the final rendering. Such operation is performed by the CPU, once the GPU image has been transferred in a single copy operation. 

\subsection{Remarks}
Note that for both small and medium particles the main drawback of the proposed solutions
is represented by the overhead associated with the sorting and reduction operations. Specifically the sorting is intrinsically time-consuming requiring intensive usage of memory.
The performance of rendering medium particles is mainly influenced
by the size of shared memory which limits the number of resident blocks
per multiprocessor during the execution of the kernel, thus reducing device occupancy. 
%(see Section~\ref{sec:gpuperf}).
A further issue is related to the unbalanced work load among blocks; the number of particles within each tile can vary significantly. All these aspects are discussed and quantitatively analyzed in Section~5.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/box.eps}
%\caption{Mass distriN-body cosmological simulation }
%\label{fig:box}
%\end{figure}

An N-body simulation performed using Gadget \cite{gadgeturl} was used for the tests we discuss in this section. The simulation is based on about 400 million particles consisting of 200 million {\it dark matter} particles, 200 million baryonic matter particles (hereafter referred to as {\it gas}) and around 10 million {\it star} particles. Particles possess a number of physical quantities, e.g. vectors capturing spatial coordinates and velocities, or scalars representing smoothing length. Additionally gas particles are associated with {\it temperature} and {\it mass density}. Also, {\it spectral type} and {\it age} are properties of star particles. Such quantities can be exploited in highly-detailed renderings, e.g. by modulating colors and intensities appropriately. 

We used GCC 4.4.6 and CUDA 5.0 for compilation. Execution was performed on a computing node containing a dual-socket six-core Intel Xeon 5650 2.6 GHz processor with 24 GB shared memory and a pair of NVIDIA Tesla M2090 GPUs with 6 GB of GDDR5 memory, 177 GB/sec main memory bandwidth and peak performance of 665 GFlops/sec. Although such a large memory computing node is necessary for handling our test simulation ($\approx 7.5$ GB) no GPU issues arise as particles are loaded in small chunks. Next we analyze our GPU implementation comparing to the parallelized CPU Splotch. 

\subsection{Tuning}
\label{sec:gpuperf}
To perform the tests presented in this section an important aspect is ensuring high {\it occupancy} to avoid cores remaining idle during kernel execution. Occupancy depends upon the number of threads per block, the number of registers and the size of shared memory used in kernels - these define the number of resident CUDA blocks (blocks/SM) during execution. We have empirically estimated a trade-off among these parameters for the rendering kernel of our implementation. This kernel may potentially use significant shared memory due to the fact that Btiles together with a number of particles need to be stored. As the boundary width of Btiles is critical for realizing particle classification and determining sizes of CUDA blocks, we suggest to set this no larger than 8 due to the typically small shared memory and focus instead on optimizing the relevant number of particles ($n_p$) and the size of tiles (for simplicity we assume square tiles $t_x^2$ only) respectively.

A number of possible $n_p$ and $t_x$ values are illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:tuning}. We consider a situation in which the majority of particles is non-large so that they are processed by the GPU. This way we obtain meaningful rendering times for our optimization as the host computation is indeed overlapped by the device computation completely. We observe that storing Btiles together with a fixed number of particles in shared memory (for optimizing memory access) restricts full GPU occupancy. The maximum occupancy obtained is $66.7\%$ for small tiles ($t_x = 10$ or $t_x = 12$) and small chunks of particles ($n_p = 32$ or $n_p=64$). Taking into account total CUDA times, optimal performance is achieved for $n_p=64$ and $t_x = 12$, so we employ these values for testing in the next sections.

Note that the tile size is also relevant to the load balancing among different blocks: as tile size decreases the work load becomes less unbalanced. 
%However this problem cannot completely overcome when the dataset distribution is heterogenous at all scales. Therefore a further investigation must be done for this issue.

%\subsection{Performance Analysis}
%\label{sec:performance}
%This section discusses performances of our implementation in terms of scalability with the sizes of datasets %and rendered images (Section~\ref{sec:scalability}), comparison with the CPU version (Section~%\ref{sec:speed-up}) and the GPU overhead (Section~\ref{sec:overhead}).

\subsection{Scalability}
\label{sec:scalability}
To analyze scalability in terms of sizes of datasets we fixed the size of rendered images and camera settings so that all particles are classified as non-large and are thus processed by the GPU entirely. 
Figure~\ref{fig:scalability} illustrates the obtained timings when progressively increasing the overall number of particles
from about $0.5\times10^7$ to roughly $2.2\times10^8$. Computing times scale linearly confirming that this feature of the original CPU Splotch is preserved. 
\begin{figure}

\caption{Scalability of Splotch kernels on the GPU in relation to dataset sizes. 
The lines are colored as follows: a) black (diamonds) showing total computing times, b) red (squares) showing rendering times, c) blue (crosses) representing overhead times and finally d) green (triangles) illustrating rasterization times.}
\label{fig:scalability}
\end{figure}

%OPEN

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/pixels.eps}
\caption{Splotch's scalability on the GPU in relation to image side $N_{pix}$ (camera settings are fixed).}
\label{fig:pixels}
\end{figure}

We observe a perfect linear scalability of the rendering times with respect to $N_{part}$ representing one of two main contributions to overall computing times, 
the other being the sum of the overheads related to all those parts specific to the GPU code 
refactoring (e.g. times for host-device copy or distribution of particles - see Section~\ref{sec:overhead}). 
Rasterization requires instead a negligible fraction of the overall time being always less than 10\%. 

%\subsubsection{Image Sizes}
%\label{sec:imagesizes}
Overall performance in relation to image sizes $N_{pix}^2$ is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pixels}. Keeping the underlying dataset size and camera settings fixed, we obtained computing times by progressively increasing
$N_{pix}$ from ${2}^{7}$ to ${2}^{12}$. According to \eqref{ops} and \eqref{radius} each particle contributes to a number of pixels that is proportional to $N_{pix}^{2}$. As long as image sizes are small relative to dataset sizes (for our particular configuration this translates to $N_{pix} \le 2^{11}$), overall computing times are constant. For large image sizes their resolution may affect significantly the classification of particles potentially increasing overall computing times.
 
\subsection{Speed-up}
\label{sec:speed-up}
In the next series of tests, we discuss the speed-up achieved with respect to the CPU Splotch. 
The dependency of the computing time from the radius, defined by equation \eqref{radius}, has been analysed maintaining a fixed image resolution at ($N_{pix} = 2^{11}$) and progressively changing the camera position 
so as to resemble a typical user interaction scenario, namely a zoom in operation. 
The starting camera position ensures that the entire box of the simulation is rendered (Test 1). 
Next we ensure that the simulation box just about fits into the rendered images (Test 2). 
A few other camera positions have also been set so as to reach closer and closer towards the 
centre of the simulation (Tests 3 to 7). Figure~\ref{fig:panorama} illustrates rendered images generated for the different camera positions.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{images/panorama.eps}
\caption{Our reference particle simulation as rendered by Splotch at a number of different camera positions mimicing a zoom-in operation.

%OPEN
%CLAUDIO - CHECK CAPTION, which Test is not presented?
\label{fig:panorama}
\end{figure}

We observe that approaching the center of the simulation results in larger radii 
as expressed by the average $R_0=<r(p)>$ radius and illustrated by Figure~\ref{fig:radii}. 
Table~\ref{tab:radius} presents these values together with the number of active particles and computing times. As we approach the centre of the simulation fewer particles are active, an increasingly larger 
number being outside the scene - this leads to a reduction in computing times. At the same
time, however, particles are closer to the camera and their radius increases contributing to 
a progressively larger number of screen pixels,
thus increasing computing times with the square of their radius. 
These trends tend to compensate maintaining on average 0 to 16 seconds overall times.

%\subsection{Discussion}
%\label{sec:discussion}
CPU Splotch timings were obtained exploiting the OpenMP paradigm on 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 processors respectively. OpenMP was selected (instead of MPI) as the design of this parallelized CPU Splotch is conceptually closer to our CUDA implementation (see Section~\ref{sec:overview}). The results are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:gpucpu} as a function of computing times per particle, since the number of processed particles depends on camera settings.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/scalaomp.eps}
\caption{GPU and CPU comparison in relation to the particles' radius. The black curve represents GPU computing times. Blue curves are CPU times ranging from 12 cores (light blue, OMP12) to 1 core (dark blue, OMP1).}
\label{fig:gpucpu}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/speedup.eps}
\caption{
Observed speed-ups for rendering (red curve, squares) and rasterization (black curve, diamonds) kernels defined as ratios among computing times required for execution by the GPU and CPU respectively.
}
\label{fig:speedup}
\end{figure}

Note that the GPU curve exhibits a bi-modal behaviour depending upon the radius. For small values, computing times are almost constant since the overall calculation is dominated by $N_{part}$. For values larger than unity the dependency from the square of the radius dominates and computing times rise rapidly. The comparison between the GPU and the multicore performance show that at small radii ($R_0 < 2$) the speed-up gained by the GPU implementation can be larger than a factor of 6 compared to a single CPU. Considering the OpenMP implementation of Splotch we observe that within this range of radii, GPU performance is comparable to that obtained from 8 cores. This is because parallel codes do not scale linearly with the number of processors. At large radii ($R_0 > 2$) the performance of CUDA deteriorates naturally as the majority of particles is CPU processed. Nevertheless assuming a worst case scenario GPU Splotch is always faster than single core execution. 

We conclude this section with a discussion on the performance achieved by all GPU kernels implemented. 
We compare computing times required for rasterization and rendering on the 
GPU and CPU respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig:speedup}). 
As regards the rendering kernel, a speed-up of around 13 is obtained for average radii around unity. For smaller radii the speed-up
tends to decrease due to the lower occupancy of the rendering kernel processing medium particles.
In fact, from Figure~\ref{fig:radii}, one can see that for $R_0<1.4$ most of the medium particles have a radius lower than the threshold~$r_0=8$ defining the size of CUDA blocks, therefore several threads in each block do not process any pixel.
As the radius grows, performance decreases due to the increasing number of large particles.
Regarding the rasterization kernel due to the {\it one-thread-per-particle} approach it is strongly accelerated with observed speed-ups ranging from 45 to 65 times. This range probably depends on the amount of active particles, that is the number of GPU's global memory stores as they are less efficient than on the CPU. In fact, as the number of active particles decreases (see Table~\ref{tab:radius}) the speed-up increases.   

\subsection{Overheads}
\label{sec:overhead}
We now discuss the GPU overheads, i.e. times required by functions specific to our GPU implementation. To this extend a number of operations are necessary, e.g. for offloading particles to GPU (OffLoad), sorting and reducing for preparing Btiles and optimizing memory displacement (Sort), removing non-active particles, but also packing and copying back particles that have to be rendered by the CPU (Select) and performing partial images composition. Figure~\ref{fig:over} presents the overhead of different GPU specific functions as times spent by the function divided by overall computing times. The black curve shows total overheads which can be up to 50\% and particularly significant for small radii. As most of the particles are active the sort and reduce 
functions (blue line with crosses) are heavy. For large radii this overhead is negligible as most of the particles are inactive. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/over1.eps}
\caption{Overhead of the various components implemented for the Splotch's
GPU refactoring. The ratio between the time spent in each component and the total processing 
time is illustrated. The black line (diamonds) shows total overhead, the green line (triangles) shows the Select time overhead, while the red line (squares) represents the OffLoad time, and finally the blue line (crosses) shows the Sort time.}
\label{fig:over}
\end{figure}
%OPEN
%CLAUDIO - Are you sure of the last point of the black line in the picture above? I think it is wrong....

The red curve represents offload times which are constant in our tests (as all particles are moved to the GPU irrespectively of camera position), about 15\% of overall overheads. This contribution tends to decrease at larger radii due to the increased overall processing times. The Select times are slighlty higher than OffLoad and this tends to decrease at larger radii, when more particles are moved back to the CPU, hence coalesced memory access can be effectively exploited. Finally, image composition (and any other CUDA set up times) can always be considered negligible contributions, e.g. creating rendered images accounts for approximately 0.1\% of GPU overheads. This is due to the efficient design of our implementation taking full advantage of the multi-thread architecture of GPUs.

\section{Conclusions and Future Developments}
\label{sec:conclusions}
The CUDA implementation of Splotch allows to exploit GPUs 
for the visualization of huge data volumes, such those produced both 
by experiments/observations and by computer simulations. Current trends
in HPC envisage the adoption of accelerators to substantially 
increase the performance of the computing systems, maintaining the power
consumption reasonably low. However, accelerators, and in particular 
GPUs, requires a certain effort to be efficiently exploited, 
supporting only peculiar programming models, that requires codes, or part
of them, to be redesigned and reimplemented before being suitable to such devices. 

Splotch proved to be a challenging application to enable to GPUs. 
In fact, the main computational kernel, the Rendering kernel, poses serious difficulties
to the GPU's programming model, that privileges highly data parallel algorithms.
In order to overcome such difficulties, Splotch's rendering algorithm has been
redesigned with the introduction of specific kernels. These kernels 
introduce an overhead that can be up to the 50\% the overall computing
time. Nevertheless, the final code overperforms the original CPU
version of up to a factor of 6, which rises to a factor of 8 when the OpenMP,
multithread parallel version is considered for comparison. Further optimization can
be obtained by the adoption of CUDA streams, overlapping computation 
and data movements. However this is currently prevented by the rendering of large particles on the CPU and the usage of the Thrust library that do not support such kind of operational mode. 
The Splotch GPU code retains also an important feature of the original
code: the linear scalability with the number of particles.
% THIS IS WRONG: and with the image size. 

Although not extraordinary, the attained GPU performance is sufficient 
to run efficiently on the hybrid computing nodes that are more and 
more common in the HPC framework. In order to fully exploit such architectures, 
a further step is necessary, supporting the concurrent usage of 
multiple GPUs, multiple cores and multiple nodes, exploiting respectively the OpenMP and
MPI capabilities of Splotch. This step is expected to pose important 
challenges especially to find the optimal balance in the workload of each of the different 
system components.

Although GPUs offer an excellent platform for improving performances of numerical codes, a complete redesign of algorithms is often necessary and dramatic improvements cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, even when moderate performance gains are achieved, GPU enabled codes allow full exploitation of modern HPC systems combining multicore processors with multiple GPUs.

Refer to poster from NVIDIA \cite{GPUTech}. 

%In principle, this overhead could
%be strongly reduced adopting CUDA streams and overlapping data copy to
%computation. However, this is currently prevented from the adoption of
%Thrust libraries, that, in its current version, does not support asynchronous operations. Furthermore,
%in some situations, when the CPU workload is larger than that of
%the GPU (e.g. at large radii), such solution would be anyway ineffective.
