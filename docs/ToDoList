1) Improvements needed (regarding the functionality with MPI)

* Usage of a parallel sort (psort ?)
  -> Sort of particles (z,hsml,...)

* Interpolating
  -> Sort by ID
  -> rearrange particles among CPU bounds

* Combination of Images on large CPU numbers
  -> Tree combination
  -> Packing individual images for communication
  -> Combine images in correct order (sort)

2) Steps for visualising large simulations

* Domain decomposition
  -> Find (x,y,z) -> SubIndex  (ca. 1000 sub-cubes per CPU)
  -> Use psort on SubIndex to perform domain decomposition

* Build Tree
  -> After Domain decomposition trees can be build fully local
  -> Find correct formulation of <C> for tree nodes

3) Additional (supplemental) tools needed

* Guesser
  -> Small, command line (interactive) tool to produce a template parameter file
     from a given simulation (which produces a 'reasonable' image).

* Interactive Scene Maker
  -> Allows to interactively produce a geometry file
  -> Should be a plug in to existing tools (e.g. Blender ?)
  -> Should be able to allow post processing results for defining the scene

4) GPU development, frozen till new person (with Mel) arrives in October

* Port to OpenCL

* Explore more efficient algorithm using less data transfer
  (multiple fragment buffers)
